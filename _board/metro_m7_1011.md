Get ready for our fastest Metro ever - the NXP iMX RT1011 microcontroller powers this board with a 500 MHz ARM Cortex M7 processor. There's 4 MB of execute-in-place QSPI for firmware + disk storage and 128KB of SRAM in-chip

We're still working on the design but here's some stuff you can look forward to:

**Features:**

- **NXP iMX RT1011 processor** - ARM Cortex M7 processor running at 500 MHz, with 128KB SRAM and high speed USB!
- **AirLift WiFi Co-processor**, with TLS/SSL support, plenty of RAM for sockets, communication is over SPI and has CircuitPython library support ready to go for fast wireless integration.
- **4MB of QSPI XIP Flash**
- **Power options** - 6-12VDC barrel jack **or** USB type C
- **UNO-shape** so shields can plug in
- **Reset** button - Click to restart, double-click to enter UF2 bootloder
- **Boot-mode switches** to get into the ROM bootloader (you can always reload code over USB if TinyUF2 gets corrupted somehow)
- **SWD connector** for advanced debugging access.
- **On/Off switch**
- **STEMMA QT** connector for I2C devices
- **On/User** LEDs + status **NeoPixel**
- **Works with CircuitPython!**
- **53.2mm x 72mm / 2" x 2.8"**
- **Height (w/ barrel jack): 14.8mm / 0.6"**
- **Weight: 22.5g**
