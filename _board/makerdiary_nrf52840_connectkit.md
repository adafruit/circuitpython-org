nRF52840 Connect Kit is an open-source prototyping kit designed for connected projects. It is built using the nRF52840 SoC, which has protocol support for Bluetooth LE, Bluetooth mesh, Thread, Zigbee, 802.15.4, ANT and 2.4 GHz proprietary stacks. It provides Arm TrustZone® CryptoCell cryptographic unit as well as numerous peripherals such as USB 2.0, NFC-A, GPIO, UART, SPI, TWI, PDM, I2S, QSPI, PWM, ADC, QDEC to support a wide range of applications.

The design is available in an easy-to-use form factor with USB-C and 40 pin DIP/SMT type, including up to 32 multi-function GPIO pins (7 can be used as ADC inputs) and Serial Wire Debug (SWD) port. It features RGB LED, Buttons, external 64 Mbit QSPI flash and flexible power management with various options for easily powering the unit from USB-C, external supplies or batteries, and also has Chip antenna and U.FL receptacle options to support various wireless scenarios.

nRF52840 Connect Kit supports [nRF Connect SDK](https://wiki.makerdiary.com/nrf52840-connectkit/guides/ncs/), which integrates the Zephyr RTOS, protocol stacks, samples, hardware drivers and much more. We also offer [Python](https://wiki.makerdiary.com/nrf52840-connectkit/guides/python/) support, allowing you access hardware-specific functionality and peripherals with Python programming language.
