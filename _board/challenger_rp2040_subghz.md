The Challenger RP2040 SubGHz board is an Arduino/Circuitpython compatible Adafruit Feather format micro controller board based on the Raspberry Pico (RP2040) chip.

This is a spin-off from our Challenger RP2040 LoRa board but in this case we replaced the LoRa module with a low power SubGHz radio module also from Hope RF. The transceiver features a proprietary long range modem that provides ultra-long range spread spectrum communication and high interference immunity whilst minimizing current consumption.

The RFM69HCW is a transceiver module capable of operation over a wide frequency range, including the 315,433,868 and 915MHz license-free ISM (Industry Scientific and Medical) frequency bands. Currently we are only supporting the 868 and 915MHz bands but this may change in the future. All major RF communication parameters are programmable and most of them can be dynamically set. The RFM69HCW offers the unique advantage of programmable narrow-band and wide- band communication modes.

The RFM69HCW is connected to the RP2040 via SPI channel 1 and a few GPIO’s that is required for signaling. A U.FL connector is used to attach your antenna to the board.
