The pIRkey adds an IR remote receiver to any computer, laptop, tablet...any computer or device with a USB port that can use a keyboard. This little board slides into any USB A port, and shows up as an every-day USB keyboard. The onboard ATSAMD21 microcontroller listens for IR remote signals and converts them to keypresses, mouse movements, or even USB serial output.

Infrared is a favorite wireless protocol - no antennas, certifications, pairings, passwords, or special tools required. Works everywhere in the world and very intuitive - everyone's got an IR remote in their home.

The **pIRkey** is an improvement on Adafruit's original IRkey product, by adding a **p** for **python**. Now with CircuitPython being available for the tiny ATSAMD21E processor, it's swapped in for the ATtiny85, giving a huge boost in power and a working Python interpreter on board as well. This means it is easy to reprogram, customize or adapt it to whatever Infrared-reading needs you may have.

When you plug it in, the pIRkey shows up as a triple device: USB disk drive to store code, USB serial for debugging and Python interactive command line, and USB keyboard/mouse that can transmit keypresses or mouse movements.

By default it ships with simple example code to read NEC remotes but **you can use _any_ remote that has about 38KHz output frequency which is the vast majority of remote controls**. CircuitPython makes this all very easy to customize and adapt to your own needs.
