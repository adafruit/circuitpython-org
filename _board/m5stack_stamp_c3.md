M5Stack just added a new family to its popular series of modules with the Stamp-C3. the new Stamp-C3 featuring ESPRESSIF ESP32-C3 RISC-V MCU with Wi-Fi connectivity for IoT edge devices such as home appliances and Industrial Automation. By combining RSA-3072-based secure boot and the AES-128-XTS-based flash encryption, while also make it optimal for industrial IoT equipment collecting sensor data within a factory or a building.

The Stamp-C3 is based on 32-bit RISC-V microcontroller and operates at a maximum clock frequency of 160 MHz. With 400 KB of internal RAM and 4 MB Flash, it can facilitate many different use-cases involving connected devices. Furthermore, the exceptional heat resistance plastic enclosure is sustained at a higher operating temperature.
