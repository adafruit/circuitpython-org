XIAO RP2040 is a microcontroller using the Raspberry RP2040 chip. It runs at up to 133MHz, is built with rich interfaces in a tiny thumb size, and fully supports Arduino, MicroPython, and CircuitPython. The onboard interfaces are enough for developing multiple applications. 
XIAO RP2040 is a development board of the Seeeduino XIAO series. Like the Seeeduino XIAO, it is a compact board with a wide range of interfaces. The XIAO RP2040 is equipped with the Raspberry RP2040 chip (Dual-core ARM® Cortex® M0+ @133MHz). Powerful performance and low power, ideal for various wearable and small projects.
In addition to the powerful CPU, the XIAO RP2040 has 2MB of Flash on board. 11 digital pins, 4 analog pins, 11 PWM Pins,1 I2C interface, 1 UART interface, 1 SPI interface, 1 SWD Bonding pad interface. Some PINs have various functions, Moreover, XIAO RP2040 supports the USB Type-C interface which can supply power and download code. 1 Reset button, 1 BOOT button, 1 user-programmable RGB LED, 1 power LED, 2 status indicators, and 1 user LED are on board, allowing developers to debug their code very easily.
The XIAO RP2040 is very compact because all electronic components are soldered on the same board surface, which means you can easily solder the XIAO RP2040 to your own PCB. XIAO RP2040 is pin-compatible with Seeeduino XIAO, so XIAO RP2040 can be learned and developed using the Expansion board of Seeeduino XIAO.
