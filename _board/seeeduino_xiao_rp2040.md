Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040 is a microcontroller using the Raspberry RP2040 chip. It runs at up to 133 MHz, is built with rich interfaces in a tiny thumb size, and fully supports Arduino, MicroPython, and CircuitPython.

The XIAO RP2040 is a development board of the Seeed Studio XIAO series. Like the Seeed Studio XIAO SAMD21, it is a compact board with a wide range of interfaces. The XIAO RP2040 is equipped with the Raspberry RP2040 chip (Dual-core ARM® Cortex® M0+) and has 2 MB of Flash on board. 

Interfaces:

* 11 digital pins
* 4 analog pins
* 11 PWM Pins
* 1 I2C interface
* 1 UART interface
* 1 SPI interface
* 1 SWD Bonding pad interface 

Some PINs have various functions, Moreover, XIAO RP2040 supports the USB-C interface which can supply power and download code. 1 Reset button, 1 BOOT button, 1 user-programmable RGB LED, 1 power LED, 2 status indicators, and 1 user LED are on board, allowing developers to debug their code very easily.

The XIAO RP2040 is very compact because all electronic components are soldered on the same board surface, which means you can easily solder the XIAO RP2040 to your own PCB. XIAO RP2040 is pin-compatible with Seeed Studio XIAO SAMD21, so XIAO RP2040 can be learned and developed using the Expansion board of Seeeduino XIAO.
