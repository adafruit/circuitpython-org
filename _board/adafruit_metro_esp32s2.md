What's Metro shaped and has an ESP32-S2 WiFi module? What has a STEMMA QT connector for I2C devices, and a Lipoly charger circuit? What's finishing up testing and nearly ready for fabrication? That's right - its the new Adafruit Metro ESP32-S2! With native USB and a load of PSRAM this board is perfect for use with CircuitPython or Arduino, to add low-cost WiFi while keeping shield-compatibility.

## Technical details

 * **ESP32-S2 240 MHz Tensilica processor** - the next generation of ESP32, now with native USB so it can act like a keyboard/mouse, MIDI device, disk drive, etc!
 * **WROVER module** has FCC/CE certification and comes with 4 MB of Flash and 2 MB of PSRAM - you can have huge data buffers
 * **Lotsa power options** - 6-12 VDC barrel jack or USB-C or Lipoly battery
 * **Built in battery charging** when powered over DC or USB
 * UNO-shape so shields can plug in
 * **Reset and DFU** (BOOT0) buttons to get into the ROM bootloader (which is a USB serial port so you don't need a separate cable!)
 * **Serial debug pins** (optional, for checking the hardware serial debug console)
 * **JTAG pads** for advanced debugging access.
 * **On/Off switch**
 * **STEMMA QT** connector for I2C devices
 * **On/Charge/User** LEDs + status **NeoPixel**
 * Works with Arduino or CircuitPython
