## About Board Versions

Circuitpython builds after 8.0.0-beta6 target the v2.1 revision of this board. V1.0 had a design flaw
in the antenna circuitry which cannot be compensated for in software. V2.1 replaces the PCB trace antenna
with a small ceramic antenna and the status LED on GPIO7 is replaced by a WS2812B RGB addressable LED.

Using 8.0.0-beta6 or earlier builds on a v2.1 board or post-8.0.0-beta6 builds on a 1.0 board will not result in proper
status LED operation.

V1.0 boards need set WIFI Tx Power to 8.5dBm in order to use WIFI.

`wifi.radio.tx_power = 8.5`
