**Onboard 5x5 RGB Matrix? Really?**

Yeah, why not! Getting compelling information out of a single RGB LED can be a real challenge, so with a 5x5 matrix, you can scroll text, show icons or even display cool animating patterns!

The RGB Matrix is powered from its own 3.3V LDO, that defaults to the off state, so there is no current draw if you put the FeatherS2 Neo into deep sleep. Turning the power on is as simple as setting IO4 HIGH.
