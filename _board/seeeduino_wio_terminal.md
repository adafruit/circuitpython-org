Instead of being a single embedded functional module, **Wio Terminal** is more of a complete system equipped with Screen + Development Board + Input/Output Interface + Enclosure. Because it uses the SAMD51, it is compatible with Arduino and CircuitPython - using the same Arduino & CircuitPython core we have developed here at Adafruit!

**Wio Terminal** is an **ATSAMD51-based** microcontroller with wireless connectivity supported by **Realtek RTL8720DN**. Its CPU speed runs at **120MHz (boost up to 200MHz)**. Realtek RTL8720DN chip supports both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi providing the backbone for IoT projects. The Wio Terminal itself is equipped with a **2.4‚Äù LCD Screen, onboard accelerometer (LIS3DHTR), microphone, buzzer, microSD card slot, light sensor, and infrared emitter (IR 940nm)**. On top of that, it also has two x JST PH 4-pin STEMMA / Grove ports for Grove Ecosystem and 40-pin compatible GPIO for more Raspberry Pi add-ons.

**Highly Integrated Design**
 * MCU, LCD, WIFI, BT, IMU, Microphone, Buzzer, microSD Card, Configurable Buttons, Light Sensor, 5-Way Switch, Infrared Emitter (IR 940nm), Crypto-authentication Ready
 * Well-designed enclosure with built-in magnets and two mounting holes, allowing you to set up your IoT project without hassle

**Powerful MCU - Microchip ATSAMD51P19**
 * ARM Cortex-M4F core running at **120MHz** using Adafruit core support for Arduino and CircuitPython
 * **4 MB** External Flash, **192 KB** RAM
 * Comprehensive Protocol Support
 * SPI, I2C, I2S, ADC, DAC, PWM, UART(Serial)
 * Built-in real-time clock RTC

**Reliable Wireless Connectivity**
 * Powered by **Realtek RTL8720DN**
 * Dual Band 2.4Ghz / 5Ghz Wi-Fi (802.11 a/b/g/n)
 * BLE / BLE 5.0

**USB OTG Support**
 * Accessible Devices (as USB-Host): read data or signals from a mouse, keyboard, MIDI devices, Xbox/PS gaming controllers, 3D printers
 * Simulated Devices (as USB-Client): emulate a mouse, keyboard or MIDI devices to Host PC
 * When using USB Host/Client function, you can use the 40-pin on the back of Wio Terminal for power supply. Check [here](https://www.seeedstudio.com/blog/2020/05/19/community-project-collection-how-to-input-data-from-a-keyboard-to-wio-terminal-using-the-usb-host-function-and-tips-about-how-to-use-the-40-pin-header-for-power-supply-and-usb-serial/) for detailed instructions.

**External Sensor Ports**
 * Two onboard multi-functional Grove ports can be used for Digital, Analog, I2C, and PWM
 * To connect STEMMA QT sensors with Wio Terminal, please use a [JST PH 4-pin STEMMA / Grove cable](https://www.adafruit.com/?q=jst%20ph%204-pin).

**Raspberry Pi 40-pin Compatible**
 * Can be mounted to a Raspberry Pi as a slave device
 * Raspberry Pi's HAT can be used with an adapter cable

**Software Support**
 * Arduino based on Adafruit SAMD51 core
 * Adafruit CircuitPython (How to [run CircuitPython on Wio Terminal](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-CircuitPython/)?)
 * [ArduPy](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-ArduPy/)
 * AT Firmware
 * Visual Studio Code

**NOTE:** The RTL8720DN isn't supported from CircuitPython. Therefore, Wifi and Bluetooth will not work.
