The Adafruit PyGamer is an entry-level gaming handheld for DIY gaming and maybe a little retro-emulation, all in one compact dev board.

The PyGamer is powered by the ATSAMD51 microcontroller with 512KB of flash and 192KB of RAM. There is an additional 8 MB of QSPI flash for file storage, handy for images, fonts, sounds, or game assets.

On the front, you get a 1.8" 160x128 color TFT display with a dimmable backlight. There is fast DMA support for drawing - screen updates are incredibly fast. A dual-potentiometer analog stick gives great control, with easy diagonal movement, or really any direction you like.
There are also 4 square-top buttons which fit [square top button caps](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4228) (available separately). The buttons are arranged to mimic a gaming handheld, with 2 menu-select buttons and 2 fire-action buttons. There are also 5 NeoPixel LEDs below the LCD screen to dazzle or track activity.

On the back, there is a full Feather-compatible header socket set to allow plugging in any FeatherWing, providinge expansion of the PyGamer's capabilities. There are 3 integrated STEMMA connectors: two 3-pin with ADC/PWM capability and one 4-pin that connects to I2C -  this can be used for Grove sensors as well.

For built in sensors, there's a light sensor that points out the front, and a 3-axis accelerometer that can detect taps and free-fall. To make bleeps and bloops, plug in any set of stereo headphones. For projects where you need more volume, you can plug in an 8 ohm speaker. The PyGamer will auto-switch to speakers when they're plugged in.

You can power the PyGamer from any Adafruit LiPoly battery, but [this 350mAh one](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2750) is suggested as it will fit into the [Adafruit PyGamer acrylic case](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4238) (sold separately). An on-off switch will save battery power when not in use. Or power the PyGamer from the Micro USB port - it will also charge up the battery if one is attached.
