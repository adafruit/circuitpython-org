This board is a electrically a clone of the [Adafruit Feather M4 Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3857), but physically optimized to fit on top of the [PoE-FeatherWing](https://www.crowdsupply.com/silicognition/poe-featherwing), filling the empty space around the RJ45 and flyback transformer and allowing the creation of extremely compact Power over Ethernet systems.

Just like the original Feather M4 Express, it is powered by the ATSAMD51J19 - with its 120MHz Cortex M4 with floating point support and 512KB Flash and 192KB RAM.  It also has 2MB of SPI flash on board.  The only thing missing compared to the original is the battery charger, which was deemed expendable for Power over Ethernet systems.  The board comes with a UF2 bootloader for easy Arduino and CircuitPython compatibility, and has CircuitPython with Wiznet W5500 drivers pre-installed, plus a `poe_featherwing.py` module that sets the Ethernet connection up for you!
