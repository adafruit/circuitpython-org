Finally, a tree that runs CircuitPython? YEP and it's better than ever! Now you can get working in CircuitPython fast with our new CircuitPython compatible development board featuring the popular Microchip AT SAM D21 microcontroller.

Providing quick and easy access to SPI and I2C (pins + Stemma/Qwiic connector) so you can get your project off the ground in no time.

This board also comes with the SOIC-8 pads available on the bottom of the board to enable it to expand storage with SPI FLASH!


 * **ATSAMD21E18** 32-bit Cortex M0+ - 48 MHz 32 bit processor with **256KB Flash** and **32 KB RAM**
 * Native USB supported by every OS - can be used in CircuitPython as USB serial console, MIDI, Keyboard/Mouse HID, even a little disk drive for storing Python scripts.
 * Can be used with **CircuitPython** (Arduino coming soon!)
 * **Built in BIG 3535 RGB NeoPixel LED**
 * **12 GPIO pins**:
   * Hardware I2C port with STEMMA QT plug-n-play connector
   * Hardware SPI
 * 3.3V regulator with 500mA peak output
 * [Optional SOIC-8 SPI Flash chip on bottom]
 * **Reset switch** for starting your project code over or entering bootloader mode
