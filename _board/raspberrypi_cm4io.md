**NOTE**: This build is alpha quality and is for experimental use. It is [missing features and has known issues](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/labels/broadcom).

Exposing every interface from Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4, the Compute Module 4 IO Board provides a development platform and reference base-board design for the most powerful Compute Module yet.

The Compute Module 4 IO Board is a development board for those who wish to make use of the Raspberry Pi in a more flexible form factor, intended for industrial applications.

While the Compute Module contains the guts of a Raspberry Pi 4 (1.2GHz, quad-core Broadcom BCM2837 processor), it does not have any easy-to-use ports for development. That's where this IO Board comes in!

## CircuitPython

These downloads are for CircuitPython standalone on the Raspberry Pi (not Blinka). There is no underlying operating system. It is in early development.

After installing the disk image on an SD card, the normal CircuitPython USB workflow will be available on the micro-B connector on the IO board. EMMC compute modules are not supported yet.
