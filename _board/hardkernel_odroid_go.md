**The original Odroid Go has been discontinued**

**To celebrate ODROIDâ€™s 10th anniversary,** we present the ODROID-GO Game Kit! It includes a special anniversary board with all the parts to put together your own game kit and see the workings behind such a device. It is not only a fun assembly project but also an educational tool to learn about all the hardware and software that goes into building such a device.

**Assembly and learning WHY**
Have fun building your own handheld game kit while learning about the internal functions of each part and its purpose. Learn how each button is attached to a PCB switch pad, what materials are used, and how to put it all together to create a button control pad to play games! Learn how to connect power, speakers and how to download and install an OS. Learn why certain pieces are made of particular materials and why you need certain connectors. Since the device is clear, all the internal components and all the lights are visible.

**PLAY GAMES**
Once you have assembled the ODROID-GO, you can download and install games. Enjoy your gaming device (that you built)!

**CODING CAMP**
Install Arduino and learn some basic coding. We will provide online guides to code some simple, yet cool, tasks. Then, add a weather station*, learn how to check the battery life, test the speaker, add an ultrasonic distance meter* and more.
\* Parts sold separately.
