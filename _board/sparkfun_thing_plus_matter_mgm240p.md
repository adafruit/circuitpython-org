The SparkFun Thing Plus Matter is the first easily accessible board of its kind that combines Matter and SparkFun’s Qwiic ecosystem for agile development and prototyping of Matter-based IoT devices. The MGM240P wireless module from Silicon Labs® provides secure connectivity for both 802.15.4 with Mesh communication (Thread) and Bluetooth® Low Energy 5.3 protocols. SparkFun's Thing Plus development boards are Feather-compatible and include a Qwiic connector for easy integration into our Qwiic Connect System for solderless I2C circuits.

The Thing Plus Matter - MGM240P includes Qwiic and LiPo battery connectors, and multiple GPIO pins capable of complete multiplexing through software. The board also features the MCP73831 single-cell LiPo charger as well as the MAX17048 fuel gauge to charge and monitor a connected battery. Lastly, we've included a µSD card slot for any external memory needs.

The MGM240P wireless module is built around the EFR32MG24 Wireless SoC with a 32-bit ARM Cortext-M33 core processor running at 39 MHz with 1536 kb Flash memory and 256 kb RAM.
