This development board includes a Bluetooth Low Energy-enabled ISP1807 from Insight SiP (based on the nRF52840) and six sensors: acceleration, magnetism, gyro, temperature, humidity and air pressure.

The development board is programmed with a bootloader. You can use the Arduino IDE or Circuit Python to develop your program. It has two switches and two LEDs each that can be used programmatically, and it also has a piezoelectric speaker.

It features a TPS63030 high-efficiency step-up/down converter and runs on CR2025 or CR2032 coin cell batteries. The board outline is the same as the Raspberry Pi Zero, so it can be used in a Raspberry Pi Zero case.

**Features:**

* ISP1807 based on the nRF52840
* 9-Axis Sensor (BXM055)
* Humidity and Temperature Sensor (HDC2010)
* Pressure Sensor (LPS22HB)
* Buzzer
* 2 LEDs (Green and Red)
* 2 Push buttons
* CR2032 Coin Battery supports
* Raspberry Pi Zero compatible board dimensions
