A postage stamp sized RP2040 development board with a USB-C connection, perfect for portable projects, wearables, and embedding into devices. Tiny 2040 comes with 2MB of QSPI (XiP) flash on board so it can handle projects small and large with ease.

## Features
* Powered by RP2040
* ARM Cortex M0+ running at up to 133Mhz
* 264kB of SRAM
* USB-C connector for power, programming, and data transfer
* 2MB of QSPI flash supporting XiP
* User controllable RGB LED
* Twelve IO pins (including four 12-bit ADC channels)
* Switch for basic input (doubles up as DFU select on boot)
* On-board 3V3 regulator (max regulator current output 300mA)
* Input voltage range 3V - 5.5V

## About the RP2040
The RP2040 microcontroller is a dual core ARM Cortex M0+ running at up to 133Mhz. It bundles in 264kB of SRAM, 30 multifunction GPIO pins (including a four channel 12-bit ADC), a heap of standard peripherals (I2C, SPI, UART, PWM, clocks, etc), and USB support.

One very exciting feature of the RP2040 microcontroller are the programmable IOs which allow you to execute custom programs that can manipulate GPIO pins and transfer data between peripherals - they can offload tasks that require high data transfer rates or precise timing that traditionally would have required a lot of heavy lifting from the CPU.
