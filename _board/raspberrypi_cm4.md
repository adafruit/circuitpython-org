**NOTE**: This build is alpha quality and is for experimental use. It is [missing features and has known issues](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/labels/broadcom).

The **Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4** is based on the [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B](http://www.adafruit.com/product/4297), but in a smaller form factor - perfect for embedding into products or projects without the bulk of a classic Raspberry Pi. You get all the computational power of Raspberry Pi 4 in a compact form factor for deeply embedded applications. The CM4 incorporates the same quad-core ARM Cortex-A72 processor, dual video output, gigabit Ethernet, UART, I2C, SPI, I2S, and a few PWM for good measure.

This module is available in **multiple variants**, with a range of RAM and eMMC Flash options, and with or without wireless connectivity. The modules are available with 1GB, 2GB, 4GB or 8GB LPDDR4-3200 SDRAM with optional storage of 8GB, 16GB or 32GB eMMC Flash. The wireless option includes 2.4GHz and 5GHz 802.11b/g/n/ac wireless LAN and Bluetooth 5.0 for BT classic and BTLE support.

##### **This product version of the CM4 modules comes with 4GB RAM 32GB MMC, and WiFi!**

**Note: We don't include the [Compute Module IO board](http://www.adafruit.com/product/4787), but it's strongly recommended!**

Compute ALL the THINGs!

[Compared to the earlier Compute Module 3+](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4092), the CM4 features faster CPU cores, better multimedia, more interfacing capabilities, a range of RAM densities, and a wireless connectivity option. Instead of a DIMM socket, there are two board-to-board connectors that carry high-speed signals with ease - like multiple MIPI displays and camera ports. In addition to all the pins that supply Ethernet and SDIO and SPI and such, there's also 28 GPIO pins, with up to 6 × UART, 6 × I2C and 5 × SPI.

On the video side, there are dual HDMI output, VideoCore VI graphics with OpenGL ES 3.x support, 4Kp60 hardware decode of H.265 (HEVC) video, and 1080p30 hardware encode of H.264 (AVC) video.

It's great for industrial control or robotic use, digital/video signage, IoT, and AI/machine learning projects

Compute Module 4 introduces a brand new form factor and a compatibility break with earlier Compute Modules. Where previous modules adopted the JEDEC DDR2 SODIMM mechanical standard, with I/O signals on an edge connector, we now bring I/O signals to two high-density perpendicular connectors (one for power and low-speed interfaces, and one for high-speed interfaces).

This significantly reduces the overall footprint of the module on its carrier board, letting you achieve smaller form factors for your products. This version is intended for experienced developers who will be using the board for industrial and commercial applications.

## CircuitPython

These downloads are for CircuitPython standalone on the Raspberry Pi (not Blinka). There is no underlying operating system. It is in early development.

After installing the disk image on an SD card, the normal CircuitPython USB workflow will be available on the micro-B connector on the IO board. EMMC compute modules are not supported yet.
