The SAM E54 Xplained Pro evaluation kit is a hardware platform for evaluating the ATSAME54P20A microcontroller (MCU). Supported by the Studio integrated development platform, the kit provides easy access to the features of the ATSAME54P20A and explains how to integrate the device into a custom design.

In addition to ATSAME54P20A, the SAM E54 Xplained Pro Evaluation kit can also be used for evaluating the ATSAMD51P20A microcontroller as both MCUs are identical in pin count and peripherals except that ATSAMD51P20A does not have Ethernet and CAN FD.

The Xplained Pro MCU series evaluation kits include an on-board Embedded Debugger, eliminating the need for external tools to program or debug the ATSAME54P20A. The kits offers additional peripherals to extend the features of the board and ease the development of custom designs.

Note: Not all peripherals are supported by CircuitPython.  The Ethernet, CAN, and Q-Touch button are not supported by CircuitPython at this time.  Only 16MB (128MiB) of the QSPI flash is accessible via the CIRCUITPY drive.

CircuitPython requires that the board be flashed with the UF2 bootloader.  This can be done using the second USB connector, which provides a debug interface.  After this has been done once, CircuitPython can be installed and updated in the usual way using the UF2 bootloader, or by using the debug USB connector.
