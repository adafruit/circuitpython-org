The **ScoutMakes Azul** is an open source Bluetooth (BLE) development platform featuring the nRF52840 (32bit ARM Cortex-M4 processor) from Nordic semiconductors enabling excellent Bluetooth development capabilities for your project. It conforms to the Adafruit feather format, runs CircuitPython, Arduino. The platform also has native USB support.

To enable even more integration, a 128x32 OLED is also built in along with USB-C support and a power switch for ease of use.

The platform come pre-programmed with a UF2 bootloader and CircuitPython ready to go out of box. You can pair the Azul with Adafruit bluefruit application in iOS or Android to get going. The application includes a color picker, quaternion/accelerometer/gyro/magnetometer or location (GPS), and an 8-button control game pad. This data can be read over BLE and processed directly by the nRF52 microcontroller.
