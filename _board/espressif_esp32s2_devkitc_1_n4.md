ESP32-S2-DevKitC-1 is an entry-level development board based on ESP32-S2-SOLO (on-board PCB antenna) or ESP32-S2-SOLO-U (external antenna connector), which are two general-purpose modules with a 4 MB SPI flash. This board integrates complete Wi-Fi functions.

Most of the I/O pins are broken out to the pin headers on both sides for easy interfacing. Developers can either connect peripherals with jumper wires or mount ESP32-S2-DevKitC-1 on a breadboard.
