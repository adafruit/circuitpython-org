Your favorite electronics companies have collaborated to make the fastest Metro ever! For this new product, DigiKey, NXP and Adafruit all contributed the stuff they know best: shipping parts fast (DigiKey), designing microcontrollers (NXP) and crafting great products with tutorials (that's us, Adafruit!)

We teamed up to present to you the **Adafruit Metro M7 with microSD**! An NXP iMX RT1011 microcontroller powers this board with a 500 MHz ARM Cortex M7 processor. There's 8 MB of execute-in-place QSPI for firmware + disk storage and 128KB of SRAM in-chip. Arduino-compatible headers make using any 'shield' daughterboard easy. And, as you can expect, there's a micro SD card slot wired up right on board so that you can read files or data log easily to removable, wear-leveled storage.

The iMX series of chips is the fastest microcontrollers around, with a Cortex M7 processor that is more powerful than the M0 or M4, and clock speeds of 500MHz+. For pure performance, there's nothing better! This chip family is well known for being featured in the Teensy 4 dev board series. Now we have a Metro-shaped board so you can use many Arduino shields, that is fully open source so you can adapt the design to create your own custom layouts, and a USB drag-n-drop bootloader plus CircuitPython support for easy development. Beginners and experts alike will enjoy the combination of low cost, roomy memory and storage, and no-soldering quick start.

Please note that this board does *not* have Arduino or Platform.io support. You can program it with CircuitPython, a fast-to-start embedded version of the popular Python programming language, or with [MCU Xpresso IDE for C/C++ advanced embedded development](https://www.nxp.com/design/software/development-software/mcuxpresso-software-and-tools-/mcuxpresso-integrated-development-environment-ide:MCUXpresso-IDE).

**Features:**

- **NXP iMX RT1011 processor** - ARM Cortex M7 processor running at 500 MHz, with 128KB SRAM and high-speed USB!
- **Micro SD Card Slot -** For audio files, images, scripts, or data logging. Uses SPI port and a chip select pin
- **8MB of QSPI XIP Flash**
- **Power options** - 6-12VDC barrel jack **or** USB type C
- **Arduino-UNO-shape** so shields can plug in
- **Reset** button - Click to restart, double-click to enter UF2 bootloader
- **Boot-mode switches** to get into the ROM bootloader (you can always reload code over USB if TinyUF2 gets corrupted somehow)
- **SWD connector** for advanced debugging access.
- **On/Off switch**
- **STEMMA QT** connector for I2C devices
- **On/User** LEDs + status **NeoPixel**
- **Works with CircuitPython!**
