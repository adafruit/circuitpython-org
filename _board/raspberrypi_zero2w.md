**NOTE**: This build is alpha quality and is for experimental use. It is [missing features and has known issues](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/labels/broadcom).

**Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W** is the latest product in Raspberry Pi's most affordable range of single-board computers. The successor to the breakthrough Raspberry Pi Zero W, **Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W** is a form factorâ€“compatible drop-in replacement for the original board.

The board incorporates a quad-core 64-bit Arm Cortex-A53 CPU, clocked at 1GHz. At its heart is a Raspberry Pi RP3A0 system-in-package (SiP), integrating a Broadcom BCM2710A1 die with 512MB of LPDDR2 SDRAM. The upgraded processor provides Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W with 40% more single-threaded performance, and five times more multi-threaded performance, than the original single-core Raspberry Pi Zero. Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W offers 2.4GHz 802.11 b/g/n wireless LAN and Bluetooth 4.2, along with support for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and modular compliance certification.

The board has a microSD card slot, a CSI-2 camera connector, a USB On-The-Go (OTG) port, and an unpopulated footprint for a HAT-compatible 40-pin GPIO header. It is powered via a micro USB socket. Video output is via a mini HDMI port; composite video output can easily be made available via test points, if needed. Sharing the same form factor as the original Raspberry Pi Zero, Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W fits inside most existing Raspberry Pi Zero cases.

## CircuitPython

These downloads are for CircuitPython standalone on the Raspberry Pi (not Blinka). There is no underlying operating system. It is in early development.

After installing the disk image on an SD card, the normal CircuitPython USB workflow is available over the micro-B USB connector labeled "USB".
