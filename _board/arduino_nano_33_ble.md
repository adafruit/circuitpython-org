This compact and reliable NANO board is built around the NINA B306 module, based on Nordic nRF 52840 and containing a powerful Cortex M4F. Its architecture, fully compatible with Arduino IDE Online and Offline, has a 9 axis Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and a reduced power consumption compared to other same size boards.
This allows the design of wearable devices and movement sensing projects that need to communicate to other devices at a close range. Arduino NANO 33 BLE is also ideal for automation projects thanks to the multiprotocol BT 5.0 radio.

To use this board with CircuitPython you must [replace the existing bootloader](https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=60&t=158279) with the Adafruit UF2 bootloader. You need to restore the original bootloader to use the board again with Arduino.
