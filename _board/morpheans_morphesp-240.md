While there are many ESP32 dev boards on the market, we here at [Morpheans](http://www.morpheans.com/) found ourselves lamenting the scarcity of such boards for the new ESP32-*S2*. So we decided to build one. **Introducing MorphESP 240, an easy-to-use, Arduino- and CircuitPython-compatible, open hardware ESP32-S2 dev board with a built-in high-resolution, IPS-color display.**

Our target was *minimalism with room to grow*, and—after squeezing the following specs into a 20 g, 89 x 28 x 6 mm package—we believe we’ve hit the bullseye:

- An ESP32-S2 WROOM with
  - A 240 MHz single-core microcontroller
  - 128 KB of ROM
  - 320 KB of SRAM
  - 802.11 b/g/n/ 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi
- An on-board, SPI-driven, 240 x 240 pixel ST7789 display
- A classic, multi-color WS2812B RGB LED
- A built-in, JST-connected battery with a USB charging module
- A 5 V to 3.3 V regulator to feed additional modules
- Plenty of GPIOs to play with
