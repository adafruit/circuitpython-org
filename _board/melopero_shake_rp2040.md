The **Melopero Shake RP2040** is a powerful development board based on the **Raspberry Pi RP2040** microcontroller, programmable in C/C++, MicroPython, CircuitPython and Arduino.

The board features:

* **16MB** of FLASH Memory
* 3.7-4.2 LiPo **battery charger** (200mA charge curret)
* **Battery monitor** (it sends an alert when the battery voltage drops at 3.4V)
* Reset and boot buttons (no need to detach/attach the board to enter boot mode)
* **Qwiic/Stemma QT connector** for attaching lots of Melopero, Adafruit and * SparkFun sensors
* Classic **Feather pinout** for maximum compatibility
* USB-C connector for powering, programming and charging
* JST 2-pin connector for attaching the battery (we follow the Adafruit and SparkFun batteries polarity)
* Green user LED on pin 13
* **RGB WS2812 LED** (aka NeoPixel)
* Orange LED for signaling the charging status
* SWD header for debugging
* 4 mounting holes
* Programmable in **C/C++**, **MicroPython**, **CircuitPython** and **Arduino**
