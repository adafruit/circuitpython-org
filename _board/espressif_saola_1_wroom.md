This is the Saola development board with a WROOM ESP32-S2 module.

The micro USB connector on the Saola is wired through a CP210x USB to serial converter chip for debugging and programming. The native USB is not available on a USB connector - instead you'll want to pick up a [Micro B USB](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1833) connector breakout, [USB-C](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4090) connector breakout or [USB data cable](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4448) and hand-wire D19/D20 to D- and D+ pads.
