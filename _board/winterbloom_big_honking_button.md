Winterbloom Big Honking Button is a modular synthesizer (Eurorack) module. It is very simple sampler in a very silly package. It makes a nice goose honk when you press its large orange button, and you can use CircuitPython to customize its behavior and samples.

## Purchase

The BHB is available for purchase on [Winterbloom.com](https://winterbloom.com) and several modular synthesizer distributors.
