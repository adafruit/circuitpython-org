One of our favorite Feathers, the Feather M4 Express, gets a glow-up here with an upgrade to the SAME51 chipset which has built-in CAN bus support! Like its SAMD51 cousin, the ATSAME51J19 comes with a 120 MHz Cortex M4 with floating point support and 512 KB Flash and 192 KB RAM. Your code will zig and zag and zoom, and with a bunch of extra peripherals for support, this will for sure be your favorite new chipset for CAN interfacing projects.

At the end of the board we have placed a CAN transceiver chip as well as a 5 V converter to generate 5 V power to the transceiver even when running on battery. The two CAN signal lines and ground reference signal are available on a 3-pin 3.5 mm terminal block. The chip and booster can be put to sleep for power saving. The built-in CAN can read or write packets and has support in both Arduino and CircuitPython.

Like the original Feather M4 Express, you'll find a Mini NeoPixel and 2 MB SPI Flash. When used in CircuitPython, the 2 MB flash acts as storage for all your scripts, libraries and files.

And best of all, it's a Feather - so you know it will work with all our FeatherWings! What a great way to quickly get up and running. It's even pin-compatible with the original Feather M4.

Easy reprogramming: the Feather M4 CAN comes pre-loaded with the UF2 bootloader, which looks like a USB storage key. Simply drag firmware on to program, no special tools or drivers needed! It can be used to load up CircuitPython or Arduino IDE (it is bossa-compatible).

Comes fully assembled and tested, with the UF2 USB bootloader. We also toss in some headers so you can solder it in and plug into a solderless breadboard.
