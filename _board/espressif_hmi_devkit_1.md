Espressif's **ESP32-S2 Human Machine Interface Dev Kit 1 (ESP32-S2-HMI-DevKit-1)** has been specifically designed for human-machine interfaces in smart-home automation controllers, smart speakers with display, smart alarm clocks, etc.

ESP32-S2-HMI-DevKit-1 is powered by the [ESP32-S2-WROVER module](https://www.adafruit.com/?q=S2+WROVER&sort=BestMatch), which supports a 4.3" LCD screen. The development board can have an _optional_ 1,950mAh rechargeable lithium battery installed. There's lots of peripheral interfaces such as an extra USB serial programming/UART port, SPI, TWAI, I2C, and an SD card. It supports various sensors and functions such as audio playback and recording. Additionally, this development kit supports rapid secondary development, allowing developers to take advantage of the kit’s various onboard resources and expansion interfaces.

Please note this is an advanced development kit, for use with the 'raw' Espressif ESP IDF. For example, there isn't CircuitPython or Arduino support for the display at this time. We're stocking this because we think its a great dev board if you want to implement support for this hardware or play with display interfaces and the ESP32-S2
