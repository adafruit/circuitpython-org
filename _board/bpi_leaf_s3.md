The BPI-Leaf-S3 is a basic development board equipped ESP32-S3R2 chip , provides Wi-Fi and Bluetooth LE functions via PCB antenna.

**Features:**

- **ESP32-S3R2**: Xtensa® dual-core 32-bit LX7 microprocessor,
up to 240 MHz; 2.4G Wi-Fi + Bluetooth LE; RISC-V Ultra Low Power Co-processor; **2 MB Quad SPI PSRAM** is integrated in the package, so don't worry too much about using massive buffers, it's basically sufficient.
- **8MB Quad SPI Flash**
- **Reserve extra Quad SPI PSRAM pad**: Keep upgrades possible, just in case.
- **36 x GPIO**: All available GPIO pins, are broken out to the pin headers on the board for easy interfacing and programming.The amount, order, and spacing of IO pins on board are identical to the Espressif ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1, of course is Breadboard-Friendly.
- **Native USB Port**: ESP32-S3 full-speed USB OTG interface, using USB-C Connector with back-feed protection. The interface is used for power supply to the board, for flashing applications to the chip, for communication with the chip using USB protocols, as well as for JTAG debugging.
- **5V to 3.3V DC/DC**: Maximum theoretical output 2A 3.3V.
- **Lithium battery power supply & charging**: MX 1.25mm 2-Pin Socket.Supports arbitrary switching between 3.7V lithium battery and 5V USB power supply without interrupting program operation.
- **Battery voltage detection**: On GPIO14, detection half value of battery voltage.
- **STEMMA QT / Qwiic connectors**: JST SH 1mm 4-Pin Socket, SDA&GPIO15, SCL&GPIO16.
- **Boot Button**: Download button. Holding down **Boot** and then pressing **Reset** initiates Firmware Download mode for downloading firmware through the serial port or USB port.
- **Reset Button** New v1.1 version support double-clicking the reset button to enter the UF2 bootloader.
- **RGB LED**: Addressable RGB LED, driven by GPIO48.
- **Power LED**: Steady on when power is supplied.
- **Charging LED**: Always off when only the battery is powered, slightly on when only the USB 5V is powered, and always on when the battery is charging.
