### Description

Seeed Studi0 XIAO ESP32S3 adopts a highly integrated ESP32-S3 SoC with built-in ***Xtensa LX7 dual core, 32-bit processor*** that operates at ***up to 240 MHz***. The chip has ***8MB PSRAM and 8MB Flash***, which can provide greater programming space and better performance, and bring more possibilities for I0T control scenarios

Wireless stack supports Complete ***2.4GHz Wi Fi subsystem BLE Bluetooth 5.0, Bluetooth mesh***.

This new XIAO is equipped with a ***high-performance car mounted ceramic antenna***, which can reach a maximum range of 80m BLE/Wi Fi, and it also
Reserved ***an interface for the external UFL antenna***. At the same time, it is also equipped with optimized power management functions. It has four types The power mode and onboard lithium battery charging management circuit can operate in deep sleep mode with a current as ***low as 14ux***, Make it very suitable for current battery powered applications.


XIAO ESP32S3 is still a classic XIAO Design. Its design is suitable for ***21x17.8mm***, XIAO standard size, while maintaining its classic single-sided component safety Install. Even though it is only the size of a thumb, it astonishingly taps a total of ***15 GPIO pins***, including ***11 digital I/O for PWM pins and analog I/O for 9 ADC pins***. It supports UART, IIC, and SPI serial communication ports, all of which make it ideal for space constrained projects such as wearable devices, or for use with Production ready units designed for PCBA.
