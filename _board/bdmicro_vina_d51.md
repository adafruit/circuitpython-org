The VINA-D51 is a powerful, robust, pluggable control module designed for modular control applications, even in harsh environments. Built with all-industrial grade components, latching connectors and features, it is well-suited for a wide variety of automation and control applications.

* **Performance**: Powerful 32-bit ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller @ 120 MHz, based on the Microchip ATSAMD51N20 with 1 MB of program flash and 256 KB of RAM.
* **Industrial grade**: All industrial spec parts and Latch-Lock connectors for reliable operation in demanding applications.
* **Connectivitiy**:
  * USB interface for connecting to your development PC or Laptop computer for programming.
  * provides virtual COM port for CircuitPython console and UART, and mass storage filesystem interface to the 64 MB on-board QSPI flash for programs and data storage.
* **Control & interfacing**:
  * RS485, I2C, WIFI & Expansion: Latching RS485 interface connector on-board which is a UART-style differential bus with high noise immunity common in manufacturing and control automation.
  * Latching I2C interface connector on-board for sensors, controllers, displays, keypads, etc, on this commonly used bus; 12-pin AUX Expansion Socket on-board for expansion versatility and WIFI-enabled using the ubiquitous and inexpensive ESP-01S module.
  * additionally, VINA-D51 brings out 48 I/O capable of Digital I/O, UARTs, I2C, SPI, A/D, DAC, USB, and many other useful control and interfacing capabilities to the edge + 10 additional I/O on the AUX Socket.
* **Development & debug**:
  * CircuitPython and UF2 Bootloader pre-installed to get started developing right away with just a laptop or PC and a text editor.
  * With a standard ARM Cortex SWD debug header on-board, low level programming in C/C++ with source-level, single-step debugging utilizing a hardware programmer like the Segger J-Link is easy.
* **Data storage**:
  * 64 MB of on-board flash filesystem storage space for your programs and data presented as an external drive on your development workstation.
  * Soldered directly to the board, this flash storage will not suffer from corrosion or vibration in harsh environments like SD-Card type storage are prone.
* **Flexible voltage**:
  * Robust power section with wide voltage input range for flexible and reliable operation, and enough headroom to supply power to other devices up to about 3 A.
  * incorporates industrial grade Molex Latch-Lock connector that will not vibrate loose even in the most demanding applications.
