The Pico Expander is an expansion board that features a soldered Raspberry Pi Pico 2W, bringing its powerful RP2350 microcontroller to a more accessible form factor. This board breaks out all the Pico 2W pins to Grove connectors, making it easy to connect sensors and peripherals without soldering.

**Key Features:**

- **Grove Connectors**: All GPIO pins are accessible via standard Grove connectors for quick prototyping
- **Neopixel Status LED**: Built-in addressable LED for visual feedback
- **User Button**: Connected to GPIO 15 for input control
- **Reset Pin**: Dedicated reset functionality for convenient board resets
- **I2C Qwiic Connector**: Native I2C support for connecting Qwiic-compatible sensors and devices

The Pico Expander retains all the performance benefits of the Pico 2W—double the processing power, RAM, and flash memory compared to the original Pico—while providing a developer-friendly interface for rapid prototyping. Whether you're building IoT projects, sensor networks, or interactive applications, the Pico Expander simplifies hardware integration and accelerates development in CircuitPython or MicroPython.
