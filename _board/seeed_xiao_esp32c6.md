XIAO ESP32C6 is a cost-effective MCU based on Espressif’s ESP32-C6. This compact MCU excels in Matter-compliant smart home applications with its support for various wireless connectivity (2.4GHz Wi-Fi 6, BLE 5.0, Zigbee, and Thread). Designed with the thumb-size footprint and a single-sided mount of the XIAO Series, it's perfect for space-limited projects. Encrypted on the chip, the XIAO ESP32C6 ensures a desired level of security streamlined development experience, and swift market entry by integrating easily with major IoT Cloud platforms.

### Features

- ***Enhanced Connectivity:*** Combines 2.4GHz Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax), Bluetooth 5(LE), and IEEE 802.15.4 radio connectivity, allowing you to apply the Thread and Zigbee protocols.
- ***Matter Native***: Supports building Matter-compliant smart home projects thanks to its enhanced connectivity, achieving interoperability
- ***Security Encrypted on Chip***: Powered by ESP32-C6, it brings enhanced encrypted-on-chip security to your smart home projects via secure boot, encryption, and Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)
- ***Outstanding RF performance:*** Has an on-board antenna with up to 80m BLE/Wi-Fi range, while reserving an interface for external UFL antenna
- ***Leveraging Power Consumption:*** Comes with 4 working modes, with the lowest being 15 μA in deep sleep mode, while also supporting lithium battery charge management.
- ***Dual RISC-V Processors***: Incorporates two 32-bit RISC-V processors, with the high-performance processor running up to 160 MHz, and the low-power processor clocking up to 20
- ***Classic*** ***XIAODesigns:*** Remains the classic XIAO designs of the thumb-size form factor of 21 x 17.5mm, and single-sided mount, making it perfect for space-limited projects such as wearables

### Description

Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C6 is powered by the highly-integrated [ESP32-C6 SoC](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-c6), built on ***two 32-bit RISC-V processors***, with a high-performance (HP) processor with ***running up to 160 MHz***, and a low-power (LP) 32-bit RISC-V processor, which can be clocked up to 20 MHz. There are **512KB SRAM and 4 MB Flash on the chip**, allowing for more programming space, and bringing more possibilities to the IoT control scenarios.

XIAO ESP32C6 is ***Matter native thanks to its enhanced wireless connectivity***. The wireless stack supports ***2.4 GHz WiFi 6, Bluetooth® 5.3, Zigbee, and Thread (802.15.4)***. As the first XIAO member compatible with Thread, it's a perfect fit for building Matter-compliant projects, thus achieving interoperability in smart-home.

To better support your IoT projects, XIAO ESP32C6 not only provides ***seamless integration with mainstream cloud platforms*** like ***ESP Rain Maker, AWS IoT, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud***, but also leverages security for your IoT applications. With its on-chip secure boot, flash encryption, identity protection, and Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), this tiny board ensures ***the desired level of security*** for developers looking to build smart, secure, and connected solutions.

This new XIAO is equipped with a high-performance ***onboard ceramic antenna with up to 80m BLE/Wi-Fi range***, while it also reserves ***an interface for an external UFL antenna***. At the same time, it also comes with an optimized power consumption management. Featuring four power modes and an ***onboard lithium battery charging management*** circuit, it works in the ***Deep Sleep mode with a current as low as 15 µA***, making it an excellent fit for remote, battery-powered applications.

Being the 8th member of the [Seeed Studio XIAO family](https://www.seeedstudio.com/xiao-series-page), XIAO ESP32C6 remains the classic XIAO design. It is designed to ***fit the 21 x 17.5mm, XIAO Standard Size***, while remains its ***classic single-sided components mounting***. Even being thumb-sized, it amazingly breaks out **15 total** ***GPIO pins, including 11 digital I/Os for PWM pins and 4 analog I/Os for ADC pins***. It supports UART, IIC, and SPI serial communication ports. All these features make it a perfect fit for either space-limited projects such as wearables, or a production-ready unit for your PCBA designs.

## Purchase

## Getting Started
Since the ESP32C6 chip does not have support for native USB, you won't see a CIRCUITPY drive appear when you plug it into your computer. [Here is a complete guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-with-esp32-quick-start/overview) for getting Circuitpython installed onto an ESP32C6 device, and for enabling [Web Workflow](https://docs.circuitpython.org/en/latest/docs/workflows.html#web) so you can load your Python code onto it.
