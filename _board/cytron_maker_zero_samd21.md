Do you need a powerful microcontroller with low power consumption for your project? Introducing Maker Zero SAMD21, a development board based on the famous ATSAMD21 chip featuring a 32-bit ARM CortexÂ® M0+ core. 

Maker Zero SAMD21 is packed with convenient yet exciting features such as a servo ports, grove ports, GPIO LED indicators, RGB LEDs, programmable push buttons and a piezo buzzer. It has the same form factor as Arduino Uno and compatible with Arduino Zero.

The SAMD21 chip offers higher performance, enabling project opportunities for a variety of devices, and as a great educational tool for learning 32-bit applications. The SAMD21 chip applications span from smart IoT devices, wearable technology, high-tech automation, to robotics. 

The Maker Zero SAMD21 is shipped with bootloader from Adafruit that accepts code from Arduino IDE. The bootloader also allows you to easily change the board to CircuitPython mode by double-tapping the reset button and copying the .uf2 file that contains CircuitPython firmware into the board.
