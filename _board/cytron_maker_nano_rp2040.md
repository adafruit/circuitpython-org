The Maker Nano RP2040 is a small but powerful MCU for your project. Same Arduino Nano form factor, but powered by a RP2040 MCU. This also means that it's compatible with some of the daughter boards for Arduino Nano in the market. Not to forget it's also breadboard friendly to allow building your own circuit.

The board has a lot of LEDs. Those LEDs are not just for a nice visual effect, they also represent the status of each pins. There are also two RGB LEDs (WS2812 Neopixel) to make your life more colorful. The onboard piezo buzzer and the sliding switch are additional hardware items which are present.

The Raspberry Pi RP2040 MCU can be programmed with C/C++ (natively or with Arduino IDE support), MicroPython or CircuitPython.

The I/O voltage is only 3.3 V and it's not 5 V compatible.
