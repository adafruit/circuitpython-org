**CoreS3 SE** is a streamlined version of the third-generation M5Stack Core series. Powered by the ESP32-S3, it features a dual-core Xtensa LX7 processor running at 240MHz with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity. It comes with 16MB of onboard flash memory and 8MB of PSRAM.

Compared to the standard CoreS3, the SE version removes the camera, proximity sensor, IMU (BMI270), and magnetometer (BMM150) for a lower price point while retaining the core functionality.

CoreS3 SE features a **2.0-inch** capacitive touch IPS screen protected by high-strength glass. Power management is handled by the **AXP2101** chip with a 4-way power flow control loop for efficient, low-power operation. The device includes a **BM8563** RTC chip for accurate timing and sleep-timer wake-up functions.

Sound output uses the high-fidelity 16-bit I2S **AW88298** power amplifier chip with a built-in 1W speaker. For audio input, the kit incorporates the **ES7210** audio decoding chip with dual microphones.

**Note:** This build includes support for the M5GO Battery Bottom 3 accessory. The SD card is not yet functional in this build.
