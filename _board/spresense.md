The Spresense project consists of a Arduino compatible board with Sony's high performance CXD5602 micro-controller. The CXD5602 has built-in GPS and high-resolution audio capabilities.

The main board uses a processor developed by Sony for IoT and sensing applications. The main board can be operated alone or with the extension board.

The Spresense uses Sony's new chipset on the main board:

* The CXD5602 System on Chip (SoC) multi core processor with GNSS
* The CXD5247 power management and audio analog interface chip

The Spresense extension board is a board which extends the interfaces compared to the Spresense main board. The Spresense main board and the Spresense extension board are connected by a Board-to-Board (B-2-B) connector. The Spresense extension board has Arduino Uno pin compatible shape and pin socket locations. However, there are some differences compared to the Arduino Uno. 

## Technical details

* CXD5602 Processor (Arm Cortex-M4F 156 MHz)
* 8 MB Flash memory, SRAM 1.5 MB
* PCB with small footprint
* Dedicated camera connector
* GNSS (GPS) antenna
* Pins and LEDs
  * Multiple GPIO (UART, SPI, I2C, I2S)
  * 6 ADC channels
  * 4 Application LED (Green)
  * Power LED (Blue)
* Micro USB serial port

The Spresense extension board has a 3.5 mm headphone jack, a micro SD card slot, an extra Micro USB port and multiple microphone pins.
