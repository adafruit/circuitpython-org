**Tab5** is a developer-oriented, highly extensible portable IoT terminal development device that integrates a dual-SoC architecture and abundant hardware resources. Its main controller is the RISC-V-based **ESP32-P4** SoC, equipped with 16 MB Flash and 32 MB PSRAM; the wireless module uses **ESP32-C6-MINI-1U**, supporting Wi-Fi 6 with an antenna system that can switch between a built-in 3D antenna and an external MMCX antenna port, flexibly adapting to different deployment environments and ensuring high data throughput and low latency.

For visuals and interaction, Tab5 features a 5″ 1280×720 IPS **TFT** display driven over MIPI-DSI, with touch input handled by the GT911 multi-touch controller (I²C) for smooth, precise response. A MIPI-CSI-connected SC2356 2 MP **camera** (1600×1200) enables HD video capture, image processing, and edge AI applications (e.g., face recognition, object tracking).

I/O and expansion include **USB-A** (Host) and **USB-C** (USB 2.0 OTG) ports for traditional peripherals; industrial communication via **RS-485** (SIT3088 with switchable 120 Ω termination); 1 × GROVE, 1 × M5BUS, GPIO_EXT header, and a **Micro SD** slot; plus a STAMP solder-pad for Cat.M/NB-IoT/LoRaWAN modules. A Reset/Boot button allows quick reset and firmware flashing.

Audio/video uses an ES8388 **audio codec** with ES7210 AEC front end, dual-mic array, 3.5 mm jack, and 1 W 8 Ω NS4150B speaker for high-fidelity recording and playback. The onboard BMI270 **six-axis sensor** (accel+gyro, interrupt wakeup) can trigger MCU wakeup on motion.

Time and power management integrate an RX8130CE **real-time clock** (interrupt wakeup); a 2S NP-F550 removable **Li-ion battery**; and IP2326 charging, MP4560 buck-boost, and INA226 real-time monitoring circuits to ensure stable operation without external power. A side-mounted Power button provides one-touch on/off.

Structure-wise, Tab5 features a side-mounted standard **1/4″-20 tripod mount nut** for direct mounting to tripods or other supports, facilitating imaging and deployment.

Tab5 is ideal for smart home control, remote monitoring, industrial automation, IoT prototyping, and educational research, offering developers and enterprises a full-featured, extensible, high-performance platform.
