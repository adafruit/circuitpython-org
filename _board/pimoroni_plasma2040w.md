This perky Pico W-powered controller for WS2812/Neopixel/SK6812 LEDs is perfect for coding up some wireless blinkenlight shenanigans.

We've taken a Raspberry Pi Pico W and added a set of screw terminals to make it easy to connect up your LEDs and boost circuitry so they get a nice clean 5V on the power and data lines. We've also added a reset button (because unplugging your USB cable all the time is tedious) and a Qw/ST (Qwiic/STEMMA QT) connector so you can connect it up to breakouts, all without soldering.

## Features

* Raspberry Pi Pico W Aboard
  * Dual Arm Cortex M0+ running at up to 133Mhz with 264kB of SRAM
  * 2MB of QSPI flash supporting XiP
  * Powered and programmable by USB micro-B
  * 2.4GHz wireless
* Compatible with 5V WS2812/Neopixel/SK6812 LEDs
* Screw terminals for attaching your LED strip.
* Reset button
* Qw/ST (Qwiic/STEMMA QT) connector

## About Pico W Aboard

Our new Pico W Aboard products come with a built in Raspberry Pi Pico W. This means you get all the advantages of a RP2040 microcontroller - a speedy fast dual-core ARM processor, a dynamic, growing ecosystem and a choice of different programming methods to experiment with. Most excitingly though, Pico W has wireless connectivity, so your Pico/RP2040 devices can communicate with each other, and the internet!
