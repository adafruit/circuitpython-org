The Circuit Playground Express is Adafruit's flagship educational board designed for CircuitPython.

It brings the "batteries included" approach includes an assortment of functionality built-in. It is one of the best beginner boards available. If you are new to hardware, then this is a great board to start with. This version includes 4-H branding [approved by the USDA](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/03/18/adafruit-circuit-playground-express-4-h-edition-approved-adafruit-4h-4h-4hgrowshere/).
