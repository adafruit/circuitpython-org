The Frood is a high-performance and affordable drop-in replacement for the Pro Micro (used in many DIY custom mechanical keyboard kits), based on the Raspberry Pi RP2040. It is physically and electrically compatible with Elite-C/nice!nano as much as possible.

It follows the SparkFun Pro Micro RP2040 pinout with 5 extra pins (GPIO12-GPIO16) added along the bottom edge (like Elite-C), and USB data lines broken out in the top corners (like nice!nano).

## Features
- Powerful dual-core Raspberry Pi RP2040 MCU
- 2 MB on-board flash memory
- Only 3.2 mm thick thanks to a mid-mounted USB-C socket
- 500 mA linear regulator and resettable fuse
- Combined Pro Micro / Elite-C / nice!nano / SparkFun Pro Micro RP2040 compatible pinout
- 5 extra I/O pins (GPIO12-GPIO16) added along the bottom edge 
- 23 available digital pins for a maximum of 11x12 = 132 switches (using a standard matrix)
- 4 pins configurable as analogue inputs
- USB D+/D- broken out for use with an external USB socket/daughterboard
- USB power sensing on GPIO19 for split keyboard side detection
- UF2 bootloader for drag & drop programming with no extra software required
- BOOT and RESET pads on the bottom of the PCB (in case )
- Orange indicator LED on pin GPIO17
