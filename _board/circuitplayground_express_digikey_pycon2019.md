The Circuit Playground Express is Adafruit's flagship educational board designed for CircuitPython.

It brings the "batteries included" approach of Python to hardware by including an assortment of functionality built-in. It is one of the best beginner boards available. If you are new to hardware, then this is a great board to start with.

## Technical details

* 10x mini NeoPixels, each one can display any color
* 1x Motion sensor (LIS3DH triple-axis accelerometer with tap detection, free-fall detection)
* 1x Temperature sensor (thermistor)
* 1x Light sensor (phototransistor). Can also act as a color sensor and pulse sensor.
* 1x Sound sensor (MEMS microphone)
* 1x Mini speaker with class D amplifier (7.5 mm magnetic speaker/buzzer)
* 2x Push buttons, labeled A and B
* 1x Slide switch
* Infrared receiver and transmitter - can receive and transmit any remote control codes, as well as send messages between Circuit Playground Expresses. Can also act as a proximity sensor.
* 8x alligator-clip friendly input/output pins
* Includes I2C, UART, 8 pins that can do analog inputs, multiple PWM output
* 7 pads can act as capacitive touch inputs and the 1 remaining is a true analog output
* Green "ON" LED so you know its powered
* Red `board.D13` LED for basic blinking
* Reset button
* ATSAMD21 ARM Cortex M0 Processor, running at 3.3 V and 48 MHz
* 2 MB of SPI Flash storage, used  to store code and libraries.
* MicroUSB port for programming and debugging
* USB port can act like serial port, keyboard, mouse, joystick or MIDI!
