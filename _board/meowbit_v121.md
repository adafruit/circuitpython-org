From the creative and cat-lovin' engineers at KittenBot comes the **Meowbit** - a handheld retro gaming computer for coding your own games with MakeCode Arcade and MicroPython. This design is really fun, with a GameBoy-like shape that can plug into micro:bit expansion boards. The built in display is a 160x128 color 1.8" TFT screen with the familiar ST7735 chipset over SPI. You also get 8 buttons (4-way D-Pad, A and B, menu and reset) to make games or interface with, and there's also a built-in speaker and SD card. For inputs there's a bunch of sensors including a light sensor, temperature sensor and even a 6-DoF gyroscope/accelerometer.
