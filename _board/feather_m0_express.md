The Adafruit Feather M0 Express was one of the first development boards designed for CircuitPython by Adafruit. Unlike the original Feather M0 Basic, it added a NeoPixel status LED and external 2MB SPI Flash for storing CircuitPython code.

It is a great entry into the Feather ecosystem with CircuitPython. However, it is now out performed by the [Feather M4 Express]({{ "/board/feather_m4_express/" | relative_url }}) which has a faster microcontroller with more RAM. The additional RAM allows CircuitPython to load more code all at once than this Feather M0 Express can.
