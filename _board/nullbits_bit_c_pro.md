The Bit-C PRO is a microcontroller (MCU) featuring the Raspberry Pi RP2040, designed for DIY keyboards. It features a through-hole USB-C connector that is more rugged than a USB micro B. It's only 1mm thick, so it sits slim and low. The Bit-C PRO ships with the RP2040 UF2 bootloader, which enumerates as an external USB drive: flashing firmware is as simple as drag and drop, no driver installation required. 100% of Bit-C PRO units are tested before shipping, ensuring you're spending your time building, not debugging. Best of all, it comes in white!
