Meet the new **BBC micro:bit v2** - Upgraded with a powerful new processor that has tons more capability and also adds more sensing with a new speaker and microphone!

The latest micro:bit will fit right into your existing lessons and materials; all the existing **MakeCode** blocks and **MicroPython** code will work in the same way as they do on the original micro:bit. More features, including easy ways to take AI and ML into the classroom, will be released throughout 2021.

It's the same size and shape as the original micro:bit so you can use the same accessories you already own.

Some new features of the board:

- A more powerful Nordic nRF52833 processor, lots more RAM and Flash so MicroPython works a lot better!
- A MEMS microphone, can hear the world around it
- A speaker, provide audio feedback, play tones
- Capacitive touch sensor, the logo now acts as a button you can boop!
- Power saving mode, double click the reset button to enter low power mode.
