The **ESP32-S2-Kaluga-1** version 1.3 kit is a full featured development kit by Espressif for the ESP32-S2. From TFTs to touch panels, this dev board has it all. Espressif designed this kit to demonstrate the ESP32-S2's human-computer interaction functionalities and provide the users with the tools for development of human-computer interaction applications based on their new WiFi modules with the ESP32-S2 chip.

Version 1.3 was released starting in Summer 2020. The original version, 1.2, [also has a CircuitPython port](/board/espressif_kaluga_1/). The pinouts are slightly different between the two versions. You can tell which version you have by the silkscreen on the bottom of the main board.

The Kaluga comes with a WROVER module, which has 2 MB (16 Mbit) PSRAM mounted for a roomy development environment!

The micro USB connector on the Kaluga is wired through a CP210x USB to serial converter chip for debugging and programming. The native USB is not available on a USB connector - instead you'll want to pick up a [Micro B USB](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1833) connector breakout, [USB-C](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4090) connector breakout or [USB data cable](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4448) and hand-wire D19/D20 to D- and D+ pads.

There are many ways of how the ESP32-S2's abundant functionalities can be used. For starters, the possible use cases may include:

- **Smart home**: From simplest smart lighting, smart door locks, smart sockets, to video streaming devices, security cameras, OTT devices, and home appliances
- **Battery-powered equipment**: Wi-Fi mesh sensor networks, Wi-Fi-networked toys, wearable devices, health management equipment
- **Industrial automation equipment**: Wireless control and robot technology, intelligent lighting, HVAC control equipment, etc.
- **Retail and catering industry**: POS machines and service robots
