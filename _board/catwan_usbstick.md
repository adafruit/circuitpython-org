Are you interested in learning how LoRa works at the package level? Debugging your own LoRa hardware and trying to detect where something is wrong? Or maybe you’re writing a custom application for your Internet of Things (IoT) network with LoraWAN?

The CatWAN USB Stick is programmed with a special firmware image that makes it an easy-to-use LoRa sniffer. You can passively capture the data exchanges between two LoRa devices, capturing with our “LoRa Sniffer” the open source network analysis tool that we have created to use together.
