This board was designed to get you to make games with CircuitPython with
minimal fuss and also minimal cost. It comes with a powerful SAMD51 Cortex M4
microcontroller already loaded with CircuitPython and some example games,
a 160x128 display, and seven buttons arranged in a familiar way. Just plug it
into USB and you can modify the example games or write your own.

## Updating Warning

If you update this board from version 5.x or older to version 6.x or newer, you
have to replace the ``main.py`` file with a [newer version obtained from the
repository](https://github.com/pewpew-game/game-m4-menu), otherwise the game
selection menu will not work with the new version of CircuitPython.
