Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C3 featuring **ESP32C3** carries a complete Wi-Fi system along with Bluetooth Low Energy function. With its exquisite design and **WiFi+BT** ability, it's perfect for various **IoT controlling scenarios** and **complex carriable applications**.

### Features

  - **Outstanding RF performance:** Powerful ESP32-C3 SoC and U.FL antenna provided that supports WiFi/Bluetooth connection over 100m.

  - **Thumb-size Design:** 21 x 17.5mm overall dimension, portable and lightweight.

  - **Low power consumption:** Lowest as 44 μA (deep sleep mode), with 4 working modes available.

  - ***\*Onboard battery charge IC:\**** Supports battery charging, great for various wearable scenarios and wireless IoT applications.

  - **Ready for productization:** Single-sided components design, easily integrated into other boards and Seeed provides [Fusion Service](https://www.seeedstudio.com/fusion.html) for rapid production.

### Description

**Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C3** has equipped a highly-integrated **ESP32-C3 chip**, built around a 32-bit RISC-V chip processor with a four-stage pipeline that operates at up to 160 MHz.

The board equips highly-integrated ESP32-C3 SoC. The chip has been installed with a **complete 2.4GHz Wi-Fi subsystem** which means it supports Station mode, SoftAP mode, SoftAP & Station mode, and promiscuous mode for multiple Wi-Fi applications. It works under an **ultra-low power state**, also supporting features of **Bluetooth 5** and **Bluetooth mesh**. There are 400 KB SRAM & 4 MB Flash on the chip, allowing for more programming space, and bringing more possibilities to the IoT control scenarios.

Being a number to the Seeed Studio XIAO family, the board deservedly maintains the classic **thumb-sized form-factor design** and elegant **productization of single-sided components mounting**. Meanwhile, it has equipped with a **battery charge chip** and integrated circuit for enhancing its ability to carry. This board comes included with an external antenna to increase the signal strength for wireless applications. There are 11 digital I/O that can be used as PWM pins and 4 analog i/o that can be used as ADC pins. It supports UART, IIC, and SPI serial communication ports, also including IIS (Internet Information Services). Utilizing its small and exquisite hardware design and the powerful onboard chip, programming by Arduino, it will offer more ability to wearable and portable devices or other applications.

## Purchase

## Getting Started
Since the ESP32C3 chip does not have support for native USB, you won't see a CIRCUITPY drive appear when you plug it into your computer. [Here is a complete guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-with-esp32-quick-start/overview) for getting Circuitpython installed onto an ESP32C3 device, and for enabling [Web Workflow](https://docs.circuitpython.org/en/latest/docs/workflows.html#web) so you can load your Python code onto it.
