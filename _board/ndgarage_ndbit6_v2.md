FeatherSnow v2 is a decoration easy to program. FeatherSnow is powered by a SAMD21 from Microchip. There are 19 white LEDs that can be controlled independently. With a native USB and a built-in regulator, FeatherSnow comes with a UF2 bootloader and a small CircuitPython runtime. FeatherSnow works with CircuitPython, and Arduino. One small addition is one accelerometer of BMA253.
