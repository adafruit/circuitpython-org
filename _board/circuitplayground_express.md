The Circuit Playground Express is Adafruit's flagship educational board designed for CircuitPython.
It brings the "batteries included" approach of Python to hardware by including an assortment of
functionality built-in. It is one of the best beginner boards available. If you are new to hardware,
then this is a great board to start with.
