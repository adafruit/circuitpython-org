A standalone, RP2040 powered servo controller - great for building hexapods, robot arms or other things with lots of moving parts. It has RGB LEDs/Neopixels for status updates, built in current monitoring and headers to add up to 6 analog sensors. There's also a Qwiic/STEMMA QT connector for adding breakouts!

## Features
- Powered by RP2040 (Dual Arm Cortex M0+ running at up to 133Mhz with 264kB of SRAM)
- 2MB of QSPI flash supporting XiP
- 18 sets of header pins for connecting 3 pin hobby servos
- 6 addressable RGB LEDs/Neopixels
- 6 sets of header pins for connecting analog sensors
- Onboard voltage and current sensing
- Reset and BOOT button (the BOOT button can also be used as a user button)
- USB-C connector for programming and power (3A max)
- Screw terminals for supplying additional power (with reverse polarity protection) (10A max continuous current)
- Qw/ST (Qwiic/STEMMA QT) connector

## About RP2040
Raspberry Pi's RP2040 microcontroller is a dual core ARM Cortex M0+ running at up to 133Mhz. It bundles in 264kB of SRAM, 30 multifunction GPIO pins (including a four channel 12-bit ADC), a heap of standard peripherals (I2C, SPI, UART, PWM, clocks, etc), and USB support.

One very exciting feature of RP2040 is the programmable IOs which allow you to execute custom programs that can manipulate GPIO pins and transfer data between peripherals - they can offload tasks that require high data transfer rates or precise timing that traditionally would have required a lot of heavy lifting from the CPU.
