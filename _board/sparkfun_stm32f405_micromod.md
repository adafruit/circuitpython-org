The SparkFun MicroMod STM32 Processor Board is ready to rock your MicroMod world with its ARM® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC core! This little Processor Board provides you with an economical and easy to use development platform if you're needing more power with minimal working space. With the M.2 MicroMod connector, connecting your STM32 Processor is a breeze. Simply match up the key on your processor's beveled edge connector to the key on the M.2 connector and secure it with a screw (included with all Carrier Boards). The STM32 is one of the most powerful and economical microcontrollers available so to be able to add it to your MicroMod Carrier Board is a huge advantage for your project!

As we previously stated; the STM32F405 Processor is based on the high-performance ARM® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC core and can operate at a frequency of up to 168 MHz. This core features a floating point unit (FPU) single precision which supports all ARM single precision data-processing instructions and data types. It also implements a full set of DSP instructions and a memory protection unit (MPU) which enhances application security. This Processor Board utilizes the DFU bootloader for uploading code, and incorporates an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals. To complement the STM32F405 processor, we've also added an additional 128Mb (16MB) serial flash memory chip to the underside of the board.
