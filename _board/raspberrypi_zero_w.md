**NOTE**: This build is alpha quality and is for experimental use. It is [missing features and has known issues](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/labels/broadcom).

**Raspberry Pi Zero W** Is the first small size (Wifi enabled) Raspberry Pi's single-board computers. This is the predecessor of **Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W** with the same form factor.

The board incorporates a Broadcom single-core ARMv6 CPU (BCM2835) clocked at 1GHz and has 512MB of RAM.

The board has a microSD card slot, a CSI-2 camera connector, a USB On-The-Go (OTG) port, and an unpopulated footprint for a HAT-compatible 40-pin GPIO header. It is powered via a micro USB socket. Video output is via a mini HDMI port; composite video output can easily be made available via test points, if needed.

## CircuitPython

These downloads are for CircuitPython standalone on the Raspberry Pi (not Blinka). There is no underlying operating system. It is in early development.

This image could work on non Wifi Pi Zero but was primarly develop for the Wifi version.

After installing the disk image on an SD card, the normal CircuitPython USB workflow is available over the micro-B USB connector labeled "USB".
