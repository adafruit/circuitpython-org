The SparkFun MicroMod Pi RP2040 Processor Board is a low-cost, high-performance board with flexible digital interfaces featuring the Raspberry Pi Foundation's RP2040 microcontroller. With the MicroMod M.2 connector, connecting your MicroMod Pi RP2040 Processor Board is a breeze. Simply match up the key on your processor's beveled edge connector to the key on the M.2 connector and secure it with a screw (included with all Carrier Boards).

The RP2040 utilizes dual ARM Cortex-M0+ processors (up to 133MHz):

 - 264kB of embedded SRAM in six banks
 - 6 dedicated IO for SPI Flash (supporting XIP)
 - 30 multifunction GPIO:
   - Dedicated hardware for commonly used peripherals
   - Programmable IO for extended peripheral support
   - Four 12-bit ADC channels with internal temperature sensor (up to 0.5 MSa/s)
 - USB 1.1 Host/Device functionality

The RP2040 is supported with both C/C++ and MicroPython cross-platform development environments, including easy access to runtime debugging. It has UF2 boot and floating-point routines baked into the chip. The built-in USB can act as both device and host. It has two symmetric cores and high internal bandwidth, making it useful for signal processing and video. While the chip has a large amount of internal RAM, the board includes an additional external flash chip.
