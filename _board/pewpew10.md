This board was designed to be an affordable device for teaching game
development. An eight by eight display, with four shades of pixels, together
with an equivalent of a Trinket M0 on board let you create and play simple
games such as Snake, Tetris or Frogger. A number of example games, together
with an online tutorial and documentation, let you quickly pick up the skills
that you will later find useful when creating bigger games and interactive
applications. A row of pins on the back also lets you connect anything you
could use with other boards, so you can also use this for playing with
electronics.
