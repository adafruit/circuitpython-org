Flexible I/O connects RP2040 to the physical world by allowing it to speak to almost anyexternal device. High performance breezes through integer workloads. Low cost helps ease the barrier to entry.

This isn’t just apowerful chip: it’s designed to help you bring every last drop of that power to bear. With six independent banks of RAM, and a fully connected switch at the heart of its bus fabric, you can easily arrange for the cores and DMA engines to run in parallel without contention.

VCC-GND Studios' YD-RP2040 has the following improvements over the Raspberry Pi Pico:
- Added PWR power LED
- The USB interface was changed to type-C USB
- Added reset button to facilitate reset operation and firmware update operation.
- Added the USRkey user button（GPIO24).
- Added RGB lights（GPIO23）
- Change PICO's W25Q16 to W25Q32（4M）/W25Q64（8M）/W25Q128（16M）
