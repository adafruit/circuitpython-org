If there is one thing Adafruit is known for, its mega-blinky-fun-rainbow-LEDs. [We just love sticking NeoPixels anywhere and everywhere](https://www.adafruit.com/category/168). When we saw the new 'PIO' peripheral on[ the RP2040 from Raspberry Pi](https://www.adafruit.com/category/875), we just knew it would be perfect for driving large quantities of NeoPixels. So we created this board, the **Adafruit Feather RP2040 SCORPIO**, designed specifically for NeoPixel (WS2812) driving but also good for various other PIO-based projects that want to take advantage of the Feather pinout with 8 separate consecutive outputs (or inputs).

[The RP2040 PIO state machine](https://learn.adafruit.com/intro-to-rp2040-pio-with-circuitpython) is perfect for LED driving: it can generate perfect waveforms, with up to 8 outputs concurrently, all through DMA. That means that you don't need to use any processor time to bit-bang-out the LED data. Just set up the buffer and tell the PIO peripheral to 'make it so' and it will shove that data to the 8 outputs without delay while your code can continue to read buttons, play music, run CircuitPython - whatever you like!

The SCORPIO has a clever pinout, where all the standard Feather pins are the same as the GPIO pins, plus the standard I2C, SPI and UART lines - and theres *still* enough pins left over to have 8 consecutive pins for PIO usage on GPIO16 through GPIO23 inclusive.

To make NeoPixel usage glitch-free there is a 3V->5V level shifter so that the output logic is 5V. If you happen to want 3V signals, you can adjust the shifter voltage with a jumper on the bottom. It's also possible to flip the direction of the level shifter to make the 8 I/O pins inputs - say for making a logic analyzer - with a directional jumper selection also on the bottom of the PCB.

The RP2040 SCORPIO also has a *ton* of RAM, 264KB, making it trivial to buffer huge numbers of NeoPixelsâ€¦*several thousand* if needed. In fact there's so much RAM you can even *dither* the pixels to for finer brightness control, for better-looking LEDs at low brightness or for gamma correction.

We have [NeoPXL8 driver code available in Arduino](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPXL8) and [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_NeoPxl8), so you can jump immediately to making beautiful artworks driven by the Adafruit SCORPIO.
