Control Electronics quickly and easily with a tiny USB stick that runs JavaScript - introducing the **Espruino Pico**! [Dig in to the JavaScript of things, with a mini version of the popular Espruino board we already carry](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1887)

This little board has an STM32 microcontroller pre-programmed with Espruino all ready to go so you can start playing immediately. **Warning: if you only use Assembly and think that even embedded C/C++ is for wimps, this device might explody your head.**

**Essential Features:**
 - 22 GPIO pins: 9 analog inputs, 21 PWM, 2 serial, 3 SPI, 3 I2C
- All GPIO is 3.3V but 5 volt tolerant
- 2 rows of 9 0.1" pins, with a third 0.05" row of 8 pins on the end
- On-board USB "PCB Type" connector, plugs right into any computer USB port
- Two on-board LEDs and one button
- [STM32F401CDU6](http://www.espruino.com/datasheets/STM32F401xD.pdf) CPU - ARM Cortex
- On-board 3.3v 250mA voltage regulator, accepts voltages from 3.5v to 16v
- Current draw in sleep: < 0.05mA - over 2.5 years on a 2500mAh battery
- On-board FET can be used to drive high-current outputs

**Note**: As of Friday, October 2nd, 2015 we are selling the updated Pico with both a more helpful silkscreen marking for power, an updated USB power diode, and a 500mA polyfuse added!

The Espruino Pico is a USB stick with a tiny computer and JavaScript interpreter built in, allowing for instant feedback from whatever device you're working with. Simply set up your code with the Espruino and send it to the device without having to wait for the board to 'flash.'

The Pico is also designed to be easy to include in your own designs and builds. The .01" pins are easy to fit in to sockets, and castellated edges mean that unpinned Picos can easily be surface-mounted directly to a PCB. And to make it even easier, [Espruino provided a part library for Eagle CAD that includes the Pico's footprint in several different configurations](https://github.com/espruino/EspruinoBoard/tree/master/Pico/Component).

The Espruino Pico's fast response time has a lot of advantages. It allows for quick and easy debugging and is a great way to test your project before your big reveal. In addition, you can control the Espruino from almost anything - Windows, Mac OS, Linux, RasPi, Android, anything that can talk to a USB Serial port.
