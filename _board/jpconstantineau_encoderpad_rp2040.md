The EncoderPad RP2040 is a Video Editing Macropad with a 60mm Encoder Wheel. This encoder is made of metal and feels like it will last forever. The EncoderPad uses 9 mechanical switches (Cherry MX type) for sending commands to the computer and/or changing the operation of the encoder. The keys are hot-swap socketed and have an individual underglow RGB LED which can be turned on.

## Features
* Powered by RP2040
* 9 keys connected directly to GPIOs
* Per key RGB LEDs (NeoPixels)
* 60mm 100 step Encoder Wheel
* Kailh hot-swap switch sockets (for Cherry MX-compatible switches)
* Included buzzer for audio feedback
* Powered and programmable via USB-C

## About the RP2040
The RP2040 microcontroller is a dual core ARM Cortex M0+ running at up to 133Mhz. It bundles in 264kB of SRAM, 30 multifunction GPIO pins (including a four channel 12-bit ADC), a heap of standard peripherals (I2C, SPI, UART, PWM, clocks, etc), and USB support.

## Powered by CircuitPython
It's not just a macropad with a big encoder but also a USB drive containing the firmware as CircuitPython files. Its Python code can be changed with any text editor and executed simultaneously, which makes it super easy to customize the macros or to add a new function. No need to download any software or setup a development environment.
