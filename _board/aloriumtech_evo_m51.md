The Evo M51 is an FPGA-enhanced Feather compatible compute module from Alorium Technology that features a 32-bit SAMD51 microcontroller along with an Intel MAX 10 FPGA.  

Designed for use as an embeddable system-on-module, all of the standard Feather I/O are also routed to castellated vias along the edge of the board. There are 34 additional castellated digital I/O connected to the FPGA and accessible via the SAMD51.

Most digital I/O connections are routed through the FPGA to and from the primary and castellated I/O. This provides the opportunity for developers to immediately capture inputs or drive outputs from the FPGA without requiring direct interaction with the SAMD controller.  

Evo M51 will support Alorium Technology-supplied pre-built FPGA images that target specific application use cases. In addition, designers will have the option to develop their own custom logic blocks and integrate them into the top-level MAX 10 FPGA design.

Evo was specifically designed to support running CircuitPython. It is also programmable with Arduino just like many other boards based upon the SAMD51.
