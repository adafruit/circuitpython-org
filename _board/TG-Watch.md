Why buy an apple watch when you can spend your weekends building a microcontroller based "smart" watch instead? the TG-Watch is an open source, not-dumb watch meant for makers who want to hack on their watch, people who want to bring python with them everywhere, or as a great starting point to learn about programming.

Some of its features include:
 * a 240x240, 1.54" lcd
 * capacitive touchscreen
 * USB Type-C port (2.0)
 * Step counter and pedometer
 * vibration motor and haptic motor driver
 * Bluetooth 5, Bluetooth mesh, Thread, ZigBee
