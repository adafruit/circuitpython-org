The Argon is a powerful Wi-Fi enabled development kit that can act as a standalone Wi-Fi endpoint. It is based on the Nordic nRF52840 and has built-in battery charging circuitry so itâ€™s easy to connect a Li-Po and deploy your local network in minutes. 

The Argon is great for connecting projects or as a gateway to connect an entire group of local endpoints. It's everything you love about the Photon, with more features like Bluetooth.
