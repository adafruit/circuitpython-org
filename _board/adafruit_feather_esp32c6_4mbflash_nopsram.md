The ESP32-C6 is Espressif’s first Wi-Fi 6 SoC integrating 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5 (LE) and the 802.15.4 protocol. It brings the goodness you know from the [low-cost C3 series](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5337) and improves it with Zigbee/802.15.4 at 2.4Ghz. [That means it could make for great Matter development hardware](https://csa-iot.org/all-solutions/matter/)!

We took our [Feather ESP32-S2](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5000) and swapped out the 'S2 for a C6. Plus some re-routing and here's what we've got: a C6 Feather with lots of GPIO, [lipoly charging and monitoring with the MAX17048](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5580), NeoPixel, I2C Stemma QT port, and a second low-quiescent LDO for disabling the I2C and NeoPixel when we want ultra-low power usage. We also [tossed a BME280](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2652) on there, so you could use it immediately as a low power temp/hum/pressure sensor.
