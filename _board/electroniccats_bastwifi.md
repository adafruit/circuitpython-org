The Bast WiFi includes the newer ESP32-S2 module, which is like a little brother to the ESP32 where only one core instead of 2 has cores, it has no BLE implemented, but gains a native USB, a new processor and crypto accelerators for better performance protection against physical fault injection attacks and more improvements over the SoC.

Please note that the ESP32-S2 is still intended for developers. Not all peripherals are fully documented with sample code on Arduino and there are still some bugs that can be found that have yet to be fixed. We know that it is not entirely pleasant but we hope you understand us.

Some elements are still in development; For this reason, we recommend this board to manufacturers who have some experience in microcontroller programming, and not as a first development board.
