The VINA-D21 is a powerful, robust, pluggable control module designed for modular control applications. Built with all-industrial grade components and features, it is well-suited for a wide variety of automation and control requirements, including harsh environments.

The VINA-D21 Control Module saves time and money by providing a proven, modular design, that enables custom application-specific solutions to move from the drawing board to the finished product quickly.

VINA-D21 enables you to develop your application-specific board independently of the controller section. This simplifies your design, saves CAD time during the design phase, reduces errors that can cost weeks of PCB re-manufacture to correct, and saves debug time during the prototype and testing phases. By starting with VINA-D21, you start from a known-good foundation, reducing complexity and risk.

Incorporate the VINA-D21 in your designs over and over again and multiply your savings. Useful for custom applications, one-off projects, breadboarded prototypes, and even standalone projects. VINA-D21 has all of the common essentials built-in, on-board.

To get you started even more quickly, BDMICRO provides the Autodesk Eagle CAD part for VINA-D21. Getting started is as easy as downloading the part and adding it to your application specific design, allowing you to focus on your custom application's needs, with all the right connectors, headers, and other circuitry needed for your project solution.

Capable of running standalone, modular piggy back on application-specific boards, or breadboarded, the VINA-D21 is a great choice for your next project.
