DynOSSAT-EDU is the first open source PocketQube educational kit compatible with CircuitPython and Arduino.

This plaform is equipped with all the necessary modules for the operation of a nanosatellite (PocketQube)
in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) that would serve as a device for teaching, training, and driving curiosity about the philosophy and technology related to NewSpace.

This is the On-Board Computer (OBC), the module responsible for managing the satellite and process sensor data. It
integrates a 9-axis IMU, a gas sensor, a temperature sensor and carries a powerful ATSAMD51.

Hardware is licensed under **CERN OHL v1.2**.
