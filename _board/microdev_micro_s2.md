Introducing the **microS2** - _An ESP32-S2 based dev-board in the size of a tiny module!_

With Wi-Fi, native USB and a load of Flash + PSRAM, the microS2 is perfect for use with CircuitPython or Arduino while keeping the form-factor small. Native USB means it can act like a keyboard or a disk drive. WiFi means its awesome for IoT projects.

The ESP32-S2 is a highly-integrated, low-power, 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi System-on-Chip (SoC) solution that now has built-in native USB as well as some other interesting new technologies. With its state-of-the-art power and RF performance, this SoC is an ideal choice for a wide variety of application scenarios relating to the Internet of Things (IoT), wearable electronics, and smart homes.

### Features & Specifications
