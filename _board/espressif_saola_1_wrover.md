**ESP32-S2 Saola-1** is a small-sized ESP32-S2 based development board produced by Espressif. Just about all of the I/O pins are broken out to the pin headers on both sides for easy interfacing. Developers can either connect peripherals with jumper wires or mount ESP32-S2 Saola-1 on a breadboard - we recommend two breadboards 'side-by-side' since the Saola is a bit wide and you won't have extra holes on one side for wiring.

This particular Saola comes with a WROVER module, which has 2 MB (8 Mbit) PSRAM mounted for a roomy development environment!

The micro USB connector on the Saola is wired through a CP210x USB to serial converter chip for debugging and programming. The native USB is not available on a USB connector - instead you'll want to pick up a [Micro B USB](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1833) connector breakout, [USB-C](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4090) connector breakout or [USB data cable](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4448) and hand-wire D19/D20 to D- and D+ pads.
