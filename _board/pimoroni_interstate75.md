Enter the (LED) matrix with Interstate 75 - a RP2040-powered driver board for HUB75-style RGB matrices, designed to plug neatly into the back of a LED panel. It provides a quick and easy way to whip up some scrolling signage or an eye-catching LED display for sensor outputs.

## Features
* Powered by RP2040
* Dual Arm Cortex M0+ running at up to 133Mhz
* 264kB of SRAM
* 2MB of QSPI flash supporting XiP
* Compatible with 32x32, 32x64 and 64x64 LED matrices.
* Sturdy screw terminals for powering the LED panels.
* USB-C connector for power and programming (3A max)
* Qw/ST (Qwiic/STEMMA QT) connector
* Reset, BOOT and a user button (the BOOT button can also be used as a user button)
* RGB LED

## About the RP2040
Raspberry Pi's RP2040 microcontroller is a dual core ARM Cortex M0+ running at up to 133Mhz. It bundles in 264kB of SRAM, 30 multifunction GPIO pins (including a four channel 12-bit ADC), a heap of standard peripherals (I2C, SPI, UART, PWM, clocks, etc), and USB support.

One very exciting feature of RP2040 is the programmable IOs which allow you to execute custom programs that can manipulate GPIO pins and transfer data between peripherals - they can offload tasks that require high data transfer rates or precise timing that traditionally would have required a lot of heavy lifting from the CPU.
