Beetle ESP32-C3, mainly intended for IoT applications, is a controller based on
ESP32-C3 RISC-V 32bit single-core processor.

On a coin-size board of 25*20.5 mm, there are up to 13 IO ports broken out, so
you don't have to worry about running out of IO ports when making projects.
Meanwhile, li-ion battery charging management function is integrated on the
board which allows to directly connect li-ion battery without extra modules,
while ensuring the application size and safety.

The equipped expansion board for Beetle ESP32-C3 brings out more power sources
without increasing product volume, more convenient to solder. Besides, the
onboard easy-to-connect GDI saves the trouble of wiring when using a screen.
