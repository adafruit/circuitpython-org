The datum-Distance sensor combines the same SAMD21G18 microcontroller used on the Arduino Zero with the VL53LX1 distance sensor from ST Microelectronics to create the simplest, easiest to use distance sensor for your application.

The datum-Distance sensor emulates a serial port over a USB connection, presents the information and data stored on it in a JSON formatted packet, and processes URI style commands to change and retrieve its settings. The datum-Distance sensor fills the gap between a LEGO® Mindstorms® sensor and a breakout board.

The datum-Distance sensor can do much more than just collect the data. The measurement units can be customized to suit your application. Distance data can be returned in mm, cm, inches, or feet. The datum-Distance sensor does all the calculations for you.

It can also apply filters such as min, mix, mean, and RMS to the data stream. This truly makes the datum-Distance sensor a smart sensor that goes far beyond what a breakout board can do.
