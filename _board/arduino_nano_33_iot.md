Arduino NANO 33 IoT board has been designed to offer a practical and cost effective solution for makers seeking to add Wi-Fi connectivity to their projects (using Arduino) with minimal previous experience in networking. Learn how to set up the programming environment and get the hardware up and running, ready for your projects, in minutes.

### NOTE: Not all on-board hardware is supported by CircuitPython

WiFi is not supported. The LSM9DS6 and ATECC chips are supported in CircuitPython by libraries that may use more RAM than is available on the SAMD21.
