**2x LDO Voltage Regulators?**
Yup! The first one is for the general operation of the board and the ESP32-S2, RAM and Flash. 

The second LDO is for you to use to connect external 3V3 modules, sensors and peripherals, and it has programmable EN control tied to GPIO21 + itâ€™s connected to the deep sleep capabilities of the S2, so if the S2 goes into deep sleep, the 2nd LDO is automatically shut down for you!

You can find out more about the FeatherS2 at [feathers2.io](https://feathers2.io), including how to [install the UF2 Bootloader](https://feathers2.io/install_uf2.html).
