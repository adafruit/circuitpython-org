The **SparkFun Qwiic Micro** is an _1 x 1 inch_ microcontroller made for the [Qwiic Eco-system](https://sparkfun.com/qwiic).
It's SparkFun's smallest microcontroller to date that's made for integrating into small projects.
Onboard is the Atmel ATSAMD21E18 32-bit ARM Cortex-M0+ processor with 256KB flash, 32KB SRAM, and an operating speed of up to 48MHz.

* **13 GPIO Pins** - The SparkFun Qwiic Micro _still_ has 13 GPIO pins, 5 of which are analog.
* **UF2 Bootloader** - The SparkFun Qwiic Micro comes with the [UF2 Bootloader](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-qwiic-micro-samd21e-hookup-guide/all#uf2-bootloader-and-drivers)
which does not require the board to have drivers installed on modern operating systems. It also allows for easy drag and drop programming.
* **SWD Programming Header** - On board is a four pin header for reprogramming the microcontroller for advanced users who want to modify
the chip to their liking.
* **Optional Circuitry** - There are pads for an extra flash memory chip in an SOIC 8-Pin Package. Check out SparkFun's site for the specific chip
used for the circuity python build that includes this chip!
