This is an updated version of the original KickSat-2 Sprite [(a tiny open source spacecraft project)](https://github.com/kicksat).

* developed by Zac Manchester and Max Holliday. 

Project GitHub: [https://github.com/RoboticExplorationLab/sprite](https://github.com/RoboticExplorationLab/sprite)

This "micro satellite" uses low-cost hardware demonstrated to work in harsh Space environments. The goal is to have all the necessary “satellite stuff” already baked in, allowing students to use CircuitPython to quickly implement science experiments in Space.
