The E-Fidget is a new kind of fidget spinner. It uses haptic feedback in the form of 8 vibration
motors to simulate the feeling of spinning while not moving at all. This provides several benefits,
including being able to be "spun" from inside of a pocket to reduce distraction, and much lower noise levels.
It's equipped with the venerable RP2040, and it's 100% OSHW! Includes 16 MBits (2 Megabytes) of external QSPI flash.
It'll be available for purchase soon, or you can download the source files and order one today!
