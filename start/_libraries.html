          <p>
              Many CircuitPython programs require you to load external libraries on your CIRCUITPY
              drive in the lib/ folder. To do so, you download the libraries in the appropriate
              library bundle, and copy the necessary files and folders to CIRCUITPY/lib. You can
              also download a Project Bundle for a specific project in the Adafruit Learn System
              and copy the files and folders within to your CIRCUITPY drive.
          </p>
          <p>
              Visit the <a href="https://circuitpython.org/libraries">Libraries page</a> to
              download the latest bundle. You should download the version that matches the version
              of CircuitPython you installed on your board.

              To learn how to load individual libraries onto your CircuitPython board, visit the

              in the Welcome to CircuitPython guide.

          <h4>Library Bundles</h4>
          <p>
              CircuitPython libraries are made available in library bundles. There are currently
              two: the Adafruit CircuitPython Bundle, the Community Bundle. The Adafruit
              CircuitPython library bundle is made up of Adafruit-sponsored drivers and helper
              libraries. The Community library bundle is made up of libraries submitted by
              individual community members.
              <!-- Eventually add CircuitPython Org bundle here. "The CircuitPython Org bundle is
              made up of libraries collectively maintained by the community." -->

              Visit the <a href="https://circuitpython.org/libraries">Libraries page</a> to
              download the latest bundle.

          <h4>Project Bundles</h4>
          <p>
              There are many CircuitPython libraries available. Each CircuitPython program uses a
              subset of these. Some use more than others. When a program uses a significant
              number of libraries, it can be frustrating to load them all manually. This is where
              the Project Bundles come in. The
              <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com">Adafruit Learn System</a> has many
              CircuitPython projects available. Many of the programs within these projects have a
              "Download Project Bundle" button available at the top. This button downloads a zip
              file containing a code.py and all the files and libraries you need to use it. We
              have made it super simple to get started with a project. Simply download the Project
              Bundle, copy everything over to your CIRCUITPY drive, and you're ready to go!
          </p>

              Click the "Download Project Bundle" button above the code in any Adafruit Learn
              Guide to get started.
