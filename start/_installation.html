          <h4>Choose a board</h4>
          <p>
              The first step to getting started with CircuitPython is choosing a microcontroller
              board that works for you. If you need some help with that, we have a guide on
              <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/choose-your-circuitpython-board">choosing the CircuitPython board that's right for you</a>.
              Once you have a board picked out, simply plug it into your computer using an
              appropriate USB cable, and you're ready to get started!

          <h4>Installation</h4>
          <p>
              Some of the CircuitPython-compatible boards come with CircuitPython installed.
              Others are CircuitPython-ready, but require you to install it. Further, you may
              want to update the version of CircuitPython that is already installed on your
              board. The steps are the same for installing and updating.
          </p>
          <p>
              To install CircuitPython, you must first put the microcontroller board into the
              bootloader. The process is specific to each board, so always check out the board
              guide in the <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com">Adafruit Learn System</a>. Once
              the board is in the bootloader, you'll see a USB drive ending in BOOT. Now you're
              ready for the next step.
          </p>
          <p>
              Visit the <a href="https://circuitpython.org/downloads">Downloads page</a> and
              search for your board. Click on your board and download the latest version of
              CircuitPython for you board. Drag the fresh .uf2 file to the BOOT drive to copy it
              over.
          </p>
          <p>
              The board will reboot, and, if successful, a CIRCUITPY drive will appear. That's all
              there is to installing CircuitPython! For a general look at the installation process,
