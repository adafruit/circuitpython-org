There’s a minimum number of pins on this chip, it’s specifically designed to be low cost and for simpler projects than ESP32-Sx or ESP32 classics with their large number of GPIO. Think of it more as an intended replacement to the ESP8266 than to the ESP32! It has built-inUSB-to-Serial, but not native USB - it cannot act as a keyboard or disk drive. The chip used here has 4MB of Flash memory, 400 KB of SRAM.</p><p>The ESP32-C3 integrates a rich set of peripherals, ranging from UART, I2C, I2S, remote control peripheral, LED PWM controller, general DMA controller, TWAI controller, USB Serial/JTAG controller, temperature sensor, and ADC. It also includes SPI, Dual SPI, and Quad SPI interfaces. There is no DAC or native capacitive touch.</p><p>With its state-of-the-art power and RF performance, this SoC is an ideal choice for a wide variety of application scenarios relating to the Internet of Things (IoT), wearable electronics, and smart homes.</p><p><strong>Specifications</strong></p><ul>  <li>Based ESP32-C3FH4 WIFI &amp; Bluetooth LE RISC-V Single-Core CPU</li>  <li>Type-C USB</li>  <li>4MB Flash</li>  <li>11x IO</li>  <li>1x1.0-4P connector(GND,3V3,SDA(GPIO5),SCL(GPIO6))</li>  <li>1x RGB(GPIO2)</li>  <li>1xLED(3.3V Power Supply)</li>  <li>1xReset button(CHIP_EN,great for restarting your program or entering the ROM bootloader)</li>  <li>1xBoot button(GPIO9,entering the ROM bootloader or for user input)</li>  <li>3.3V Regulator with 500mA peak output</li>  <li>Ceramic Antenna</li></ul><h2 id=\"purchase\">Purchase</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804679132291.html\">Aliexpress</a></li></ul>"

With the capabilities of wireless connection, it still remains the Seeed Studio XIAO series classic form-factor of small and exquisite which can be used for wearable devices and Internet of Things projects. Furthermore, it only costs 5 μA in the deep sleep model and it supports battery charge management because of the BQ25101 chip.</p><p>In addition, the SENSE version of the board carries two extra onboard sensors. One of them is a digital microphone created through Pulse Density Modulation(PDM) module on the nRF52840 chip. It can receive audio data in real-time which allows it can be used for audio recognition. The board can receive audio data through the MSM261D3526H1CPM microphone. The other one is 6-axis Inertial Measurement Unit(IMU) which can be applied in TinyML projects like gesture recognition. These onboard sensors provide a great convenience for users and the ultra-small size feature of the board has still remained.</p><p>The same CircuitPython firmware can be used both for the Seed Studio XIAO nRF52840 with or without additional sensor.</p><p>Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840 (Sense) contains a wealthy interface.

On the other side, it is designed in a three-in-one LED along with a power LED. There are 11 digital i/o that can be used as PWM pins and 6 analog i/o that can be used as ADC pins. It supports UART, IIC, and SPI all three common serial ports.

        "description": "<p>Make memories, or just a cool camera-based project, with <strong>Adafruit’s MEMENTO Camera Board</strong>. It’s a development board with everything you need to create programmable camera and vision projects: with a camera module, TFT preview screen, buttons, SD card slot and driven by a powerful ESP32-S3 with 2 MB of PSRAM for buffering 5 MegaPixel camera images.</p><p><strong>This product is just the mainboard, and does not come with an enclosure, LED ring, hardware, SD card, or battery.</strong></p><p>The ESP32-S3 is a WiFi and Bluetooth LE capable, 240 MHz dual core Tensilica processor - much like the famous ESP32. The S3 adds native USB support so it’s great for use with Arduino or CircuitPython. The S3 also has the ability to interface with raw camera modules. The cameras require 12 GPIO pins and fast data transfer in order to get images off the sensor, and then a lot of memory for storing 2560 x 1920 images - which is why we picked an S3 module with 2MB of PSRAM so that we can read JPEGs into memory for saving onto an SD card.</p><p>To make the board easy to use we added a ton of supporting hardware, here’s a full list of the hardware included:</p><ul>  <li><strong>ESP32-S3 module with 8 MB Flash, 2 MB PSRAM</strong> - dual core 240MHz Tensilica with WiFi and BTLE.</li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/5840\"><strong>OV5640 camera module with 72 degree view and auto-focus motor</strong></a> - 5MP camera sensor with JPEG encoder built in.</li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/4421\"><strong>1.54” 240x240 Color TFT</strong></a> - For previewing the camera images, or user interface design.</li>  <li><strong>MicroSD card slot</strong> - Store images or animations to any SPI-capable micro SD card.</li>  <li><strong>Two Digital/Analog Stemma Ports</strong> - JST PH-3 connectors for A0, A1 and power+ground for adding external buttons, LEDs, or sensors. Can provide 3V or 5V power.</li>  <li><strong>I2C Stemma QT Port</strong> - Connect just about any I2C sensor you please with a Stemma QT JST SH port, provides 3.3V power and logic.</li>  <li><strong>LIS3DH Accelerometer</strong> - Triple-access accelerometer can detect orientation, shaking or movement.</li>  <li><strong>LiPoly battery charging support</strong> - <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/4237\">Use a 3.7/4.2V 350mA</a> or <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/4236\">420mA battery</a> for on-the-go snaps.</li>  <li><strong>6 User Buttons</strong> - change modes, preview saved images, play DOOM (?). Connected through a GPIO expander</li>  <li><strong>Buzzer</strong> - play tones or alerts, or indicate when a photo was successfully taken</li>  <li><strong>Analog Microphone</strong> - Can be used as a sensor to detect loud sounds, not for recording video with audio.</li>  <li><strong>Shutter button</strong> - Connected to GPIO 0 for entering the ROM bootloader</li>  <li><strong>Reset button</strong> - For entering the bootloader or starting over</li>  <li><strong>On/Off switch</strong> - Cut all power when using a battery</li>  <li><strong>USB Type C</strong> for programming the ESP32-S3, as well as REPL access in CircuitPython and charging the optional LiPoly battery</li>  <li><strong>Breakout pads for hardware UART</strong> - for more intense debugging needs, solder wires to the through-hole pads to connect to a console cable.</li>  <li><strong>Four M3 standoffs</strong> for mounting or enclosure attachment.</li></ul><p>We’ve got both Arduino and CircuitPython example code that lets you preview the camera, adjust settings, and take photos that are saved to disk. However, we recommend CircuitPython because the compilation time in Arduino is pretty intense due to the huge amount of code required to run the camera. <a href=\"https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_PyCamera\">CircuitPython is fast to develop for and our library will make it easy to start making custom camera projects</a>.</p><h2 id=\"purchase\">Purchase</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/5420\">Adafruit</a></li></ul>"

        "description": "<p>The <strong>Adafruit Feather ESP32 V2</strong> is a new version of the original Adafruit HUZZAH32 ESP32 Feather. Both have the fabulous ESP32 WROOM module on there, which makes quick work of WiFi and Bluetooth projects that take advantage of Espressifs most popular chipset. We completely refreshed the board while moving from the obsolete CP2104 USB-serial chip to the available CH9102F.</p><p>Both boards say “HUZZAH32” on the bottom side, but they are different. Make sure you’ve chosen the correct download for the your board.</p><p>The Feather ESP32 V2 is a significant redesign, enough so we consider it a completely new product. It <em>still</em> features the ESP32 chip but has many upgrades and improvements:</p><ul>  <li>Compared to the original Feather with 4 MB Flash and no PSRAM, the V2 has <strong>8 MB Flash and 2 MB PSRAM</strong></li>  <li>Additional <strong>user button tactile switch</strong> on input pin 38</li>  <li>Additional <strong>NeoPixel mini RGB LED</strong> with controllable power pin</li>  <li>Additional <strong>STEMMA QT</strong> port for plug and play I2C connections</li>  <li><strong>USB Type C</strong> port instead of Micro B</li>  <li><strong>Separate controllable 3.3V power supply for STEMMA QT</strong> to allow for ultra low power consumption even with sensors are attached</li>  <li>Designed for low power usage: <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/5048\">verified with a PPK</a> to <strong>draw 70uA from the Lipoly battery in deep sleep</strong> and 1.2mA in light sleep.</li>  <li>ESP32 Pico module is much smaller, allowing for clear marking of all breakout pads and additional mounting holes!</li>  <li>Upgrade the USB to serial converter from CP2102 to CH9102F which is available for purchase! The CH9102F has no issues with uploading at 921600 bps for speedy firmware loading.</li></ul><p>However, in order to add the PSRAM, and use the new Pico module which was small enough to allow all the fun extras, some of the breakout pads have changed, so here’s what you need to know:</p><ul>  <li>The pin <em>numbers</em> for the I2C port (SDA, SCL), hardware UART (RX, TX), and SPI (SCK, MOSI, MISO) have changed. If your code has hardcoded use for those pins, you’ll want to replace them either by the new numbers or change the code to use the ‘pretty’ names like SDA or SCK.When selecting the new Feather ESP32 V2 board in the Espressif board support package, the correct numbers will be substituted.Note the names are in the same spots, we haven’t changed where the I2C/UART/SPI pins are located on the board, just which ESP32 pin numbers they are connected to in the module.</li>  <li>The ‘corner’ pin next to TX has changed from pin 21 to 37. This pin is not used in any FeatherWings because its considered an ‘extra pin’. It’s also changed from a GPIO to input-only</li>  <li>The remaining numbered pins and A0-A5 pins have not changed pin numbers.</li></ul><p>That module nestled in at the end of this Feather contains a dual-core ESP32 chip, 8 MB of SPI Flash, 2 MB of PSRAM, tuned PCB antenna, and all the passives you need to take advantage of this powerful new processor. The ESP32 has both WiFi <em>and</em> Bluetooth Classic/LE support. That means it’s perfect for just about any wireless or Internet-connected project.</p><p>Because it’s part of our <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/category/814\">Feather eco-system, you can take advantage of the 50+ Wings</a> that we’ve designed to add all sorts of cool accessories. Plus that built in battery charging and monitoring you know and love with the ESP32 Feather is still there in this upgrade.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul>  <li><strong>ESP32 Dual core 240MHz Xtensa®</strong> <strong>processor</strong> - the classic dual-core ESP32 you know and love!</li>  <li><strong>Mini module</strong> has FCC/CE certification and comes with 8 MByte of Flash and 2 MByte of PSRAM - you can have huge data buffers</li>  <li><strong>Power options</strong> - USB type C <strong>or</strong> Lipoly battery</li>  <li><strong>Built-in battery charging</strong> when powered over USB-C</li>  <li><strong>LiPoly battery monitor</strong> with two 200K resistor divider</li>  <li><strong>Reset and User</strong> (I38) buttons to reset board and as a separate input</li>  <li><strong>High speed upload with auto-reset and serial debug</strong> with ultra-reliable CP2102N chipset.</li>  <li><strong>STEMMA QT</strong> connector for I2C devices, with switchable power, so you can go into low power mode.</li>  <li><strong>Charge/User</strong> LEDs + status <strong>NeoPixel</strong> with pin-controlled power for low power usage</li>  <li><strong>Low Power friendly</strong>! In deep sleep mode we can get down to 80~100uA of current draw from the Lipoly connection. Quiescent current is from the power regulator, ESP32 chip, and Lipoly monitor. Turn off the NeoPixel and external I2C power for the lowest quiescent current draw.</li>  <li><strong>Works with Arduino or MicroPython</strong></li></ul><p>Comes fully assembled and tested, with a USB interface that lets you quickly use it with the Arduino IDE or the low-level ESP32 IDF. We also toss in some header so you can solder it in and plug into a solderless breadboard. <strong>Lipoly battery and USB cable not included</strong> (but we do have lots of options in the shop if you’d like!)</p><h2 id=\"purchase\">Purchase</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/5400\">Adafruit</a></li></ul>"

Plus some re-routing and here’s what we’ve got: a C6 Feather with lots of GPIO, lipoly charging and monitoring with the MAX17048, NeoPixel, I2C Stemma QT port, and a second low-quiescent LDO for disabling the I2C and NeoPixel when we want ultra-low power usage - as low as 17uA in deep sleep.</p><p>One thing to watch for is that, like the C3, the C6 does not have native USB. It does have a ‘built in’ USB Serial core that can be used for debugging, but it cannot act like a mouse, keyboard, or disk drive. That means if you are running CircuitPython you will need to use WiFi, Bluetooth or WebSerial for transferring files back and forth rather than drag-and-dropping to a drive.

        "description": "<p>We’ve got a new machine here at Adafruit, it can uncover your deepest desires. Don’t believe me? I’ll turn it on right now to prove it to you! What, you want your very own soft serve ice cream machine? OK well, that’s not something we can provide. But we can provide your <em>second</em>-deepest desire: an <strong>ESP32-S<em>3</em> Feather board with a built in IPS TFT color display</strong>. It’s got all the delicious creamy goodness features of a Feather main board, the comforting warmth of an ESP32-S3 WiFi+BLE microcontroller, and the crispness of a 240x135 pixel color TFT display. All that and it will even plug in nicely into a breadboard, <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/2926\">terminal block wing</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/2890\">Feather Doubler</a> or even just stack on top of another wing.</p><p>This Feather comes with native USB and <strong>4 MB Flash + 2 MB of PSRAM</strong>, so it is perfect for use with CircuitPython or Arduino with low-cost WiFi. Native USB means it can act like a keyboard or a disk drive. WiFi means it’s awesome for IoT projects. And Feather means it works with the large community of Feather Wings for expandability.</p><p>The ESP32-S3 is a highly-integrated, low-power, 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi/BLE System-on-Chip (SoC) solution that has built-in native USB as well as some other interesting new technologies like Time of Flight distance measurements and AI acceleration. With its state-of-the-art power and RF performance, this SoC is an ideal choice for a wide variety of application scenarios relating to the <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/category/342\">Internet of Things (IoT)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/category/65\">wearable electronics</a>, and smart homes.</p><p>The Feather ESP32-S3 has a dual-core 240 MHz chip, so it is comparable to ESP32’s dual-core. However, there is no Bluetooth <strong>Classic</strong> support, only Bluetooth LE. This chip is a great step up from the earlier ESP32-S2! This ESP32-S3 mini-module we are using on the Feather comes with 4 MB flash and 2 MB PSRAM, as well as lots of 512KB of SRAM so it’s perfect for use with CircuitPython support or any time massive buffers are needed: for fast memory access use SRAM, for slower-but-roomier access use PSRAM. It’s also great for use in ESP-IDF or with Arduino support.</p><p>The color TFT is connected to the SPI pins and uses additional pins for control that are not exposed to the breakout pads. <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/4383\">It’s the same display as you see here, with 240x135 pixels and is IPS</a> so you get bright color at any angle. The backlight is also connected to a separate pin so you can PWM the backlight up and down as desired.</p><p>For low power usages, the Feather has a <em>second</em> low-dropout 3.3V regulator. The regulator is controlled with a GPIO pin on the enable line and can shut off power to the Stemma QT port and TFT. There is also a separate power pin for the NeoPixel that can be used to disable it for even lower quiescent power. With everything off and in deep sleep mode, the TFT feather uses about 100uA of current.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul>  <li><strong>ESP32-S3 Dual Core 240MHz Tensilica processor</strong> - the next generation of ESP32-Sx, with native USB so it can act like a keyboard/mouse, MIDI device, disk drive, etc!</li>  <li><strong>Mini module</strong> has FCC/CE certification and comes with 4 MByte of Flash and 2 MByte of PSRAM - you can have huge data buffers</li>  <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/4383\">Color 1.14” IPS TFT with 240x135 pixels</a></strong> - bright and colorful display with ST7789 chipset that can be viewed at any angle angle.</li>  <li><strong>Power options</strong> - USB type C <strong>or</strong> Lipoly battery</li>  <li><strong>Built-in battery charging</strong> when powered over USB-C</li>  <li><strong>LiPoly battery monitor</strong> - LC709203 chip actively monitors your battery for voltage and state of charge / percentage reporting over I2C</li>  <li><strong>Reset and DFU</strong> (BOOT0) buttons to get into the ROM bootloader (which is a USB serial port so you don’t need a separate cable!)</li>  <li><strong>Serial debug output pin</strong> (optional, for checking the hardware serial debug console)</li>  <li><strong>STEMMA QT</strong> connector for I2C devices, with switchable power, so you can go into low power mode.</li>  <li><strong>On/Charge/User</strong> LEDs + status <strong>NeoPixel</strong> with pin-controlled power for low power usage</li>  <li><strong>Low Power friendly</strong>! In deep sleep mode, we can get down to 80~100uA of current draw from the Lipoly connection. Quiescent current is from the power regulator, ESP32-S2 chip, and Lipoly monitor. Turn off the NeoPixel and external I2C/TFT power for the lowest quiescent current draw.</li>  <li><strong>Works with Arduino or CircuitPython</strong></li></ul><h2 id=\"purchase\">Purchase</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/5483\">Adafruit</a></li></ul>"

Folks who have been using Adafruit products will find this very familiar - we use the technique on all our native-USB boards. Just note you don’t double-click reset, instead hold down BOOTSEL during boot to enter the bootloader!</p><p>The RP2040 is a powerful chip, which has the clock speed of our M4 (SAMD51), and two cores that are equivalent to our M0 (SAMD1). Since it is an M0 chip, it does not have a floating point unit, or DSP hardware support - so if you’re doing something with heavy floating-point math, it will be done in software and thus not as fast as an M4. For many other computational tasks, you’ll get close-to-M4 speeds!</p><p>For peripherals, there are two I2C controllers, two SPI controllers, and two UARTs that are multiplexed across the GPIO - check the pinout for what pins can be set to which. There are 16 PWM channels, each pin has a channel it can be set to (ditto on the pinout).</p><p>You’ll note there’s no I2S peripheral, or SDIO, or camera, what’s up with that? Well instead of having specific hardware support for serial-data-like peripherals like these, the RP2040 comes with the PIO state machine system which is a unique and powerful way to create custom hardware logic and data processing blocks that run on their own without taking up a CPU. For example, NeoPixels - often we bitbang the timing-specific protocol for these LEDs. For the RP2040, we instead use PIO object that reads in the data buffer and clocks out the right bitstream with perfect accuracy. Same with I2S audio in or out, LED matrix displays, 8-bit or SPI based TFTs, even VGA! In MicroPython and CircuitPython you can create PIO control commands to script the peripheral and load it in at runtime. There are 2 PIO peripherals with 4 state machines each.</p><p>There is great <a href=\"https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk\">C/C++ support</a>, unofficial (but really good) <a href=\"https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico\">Arduino support</a>, an official <a href=\"https://github.com/raspberrypi/micropython\">MicroPython port</a>, and a <a href=\"/downloads\">CircuitPython port</a>. We of course <a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython\">recommend CircuitPython because we think it’s the easiest way to get started</a> and it has support with most of our drivers, displays, sensors, and more, supported out of the box so you can follow along with our CircuitPython projects and tutorials.</p><p>While the RP2040 has lots of onboard RAM (264KB), it does not have built-in FLASH memory. Instead, that is provided by the external QSPI flash chip. <strong>On this board there is 8 MB</strong>, which is shared between the program it’s running and any file storage used by MicroPython or CircuitPython. When using C/C++ you get the whole flash memory, if using Python you will have about 7 MB remaining for code, files, images, fonts, etc.</p><p><strong>RP2040 Chip features:</strong></p><ul>  <li>Dual ARM Cortex-M0+ @ 133 MHz</li>  <li>264 kB on-chip SRAM in six independent banks</li>  <li>Support for up to 16 MB of off-chip Flash memory via dedicated QSPI bus</li>  <li>DMA controller</li>  <li>Fully-connected AHB crossbar</li>  <li>Interpolator and integer divider peripherals</li>  <li>On-chip programmable LDO to generate core voltage</li>  <li>2 on-chip PLLs to generate USB and core clocks</li>  <li>30 GPIO pins, 4 of which can be used as analog inputs</li>  <li>Peripherals    <ul>      <li>2 UARTs</li>      <li>2 SPI controllers</li>      <li>2 I2C controllers</li>      <li>16 PWM channels</li>      <li>USB 1.1 controller and PHY, with host and device support</li>      <li>8 PIO state machines</li>    </ul>  </li></ul><p>Comes fully assembled and tested, with the UF2 USB bootloader.

        "description": "<p>If you’d like quickly get started with CAN bus interfacing, with no soldering required, our <strong>Adafruit RP2040 CAN Bus Feather</strong> comes ready-to-rock with a microcontroller, CAN chipset and terminal blocks for instant gratification. <a href=\"https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/MCP2515\">The controller used is the MCP26525 (aka a MCP2515 with built-in transciever), an extremely popular and well-supported chipset</a> that has drivers in Arduino and <a href=\"https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_MCP2515\">CircuitPython</a> and only requires an SPI port and two pins for chip-select and IRQ. Use it to send and receive messages in either standard or extended format at up to 1 Mbps.</p><p>Feather is the development board specification from Adafruit, and like its namesake, it is thin, light, and lets you fly! We designed Feather to be a new standard for portable microcontroller cores. <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/feather\">We have other boards in the Feather family, check’em out here</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus\">CAN Bus is a small-scale networking standard</a>, originally designed for cars and, yes, busses, but is now used for many robotics or sensor networks that need better range and addressing than I2C and don’t have the pins or computational ability to talk on Ethernet. CAN is 2 wire differential, which means it’s good for long distances and noisy environments.</p><p>Messages are sent at about 1Mbps rate - you set the frequency for the bus and then all ‘joiners’ must match it, and have an address before the packet so that each node can listen in to messages just for it. New nodes can be attached easily because they just need to connect to the two data lines anywhere in the shared net. Each CAN device sends messages whenever it wants, and thanks to some clever data encoding, can detect if there’s a message collision and retransmit later.</p><p>We’ve added a few nice extras to this Feather to make it useful in many common CAN scenarios:</p><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/3661\"><strong>5V charge-pump voltage generator</strong></a>, so even though you are running 3.3V on a Feather board, it will generate a nice clean 5V as required by the interal transceiver.</li>  <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/725\">3.5mm soldered terminal block</a></strong> quick access to the High and Low data lines as well as a ground pin, without any soldering.</li>  <li><strong>120-ohm termination resistor on board</strong>, you can remove the termination easily by cutting the jumper marked TERM on the top of the board.</li>  <li><strong>CAN control CS, Reset, Int, standby pins</strong> connected internally so you can use any FeatherWing without pin conflicts.</li></ul><p>At the Feather’s heart is an RP2040 chip, clocked at 133 MHz and at 3.3V logic, the same one used in the <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/4864\">Raspberry Pi Pico</a>. This chip has a whopping 8 MB of onboard QSPI FLASH and 264K of RAM! There’s even room left over for a STEMMA QT connector for plug-and-play of I2C devices.</p><p>To make it easy to use for portable projects, we added a connector for any of our 3.7V Lithium polymer batteries and built-in battery charging. You don’t need a battery, it will run just fine straight from the USB Type C connector. But, if you do have a battery, you can take it on the go, then plug in the USB to recharge. The Feather will automatically switch over to USB power when it’s available.</p><p><strong>Here’re some handy specs!

        "description": "<p>Wouldn’t it be cool if you could display images and graphics from a microcontroller directly to an HDMI monitor or television? We think so! So we designed this RP2040 Feather that has a digital video output (a.k.a DVI) that will work with any HDMI monitor or display. Note it doesn’t do audio, just graphics!</p><p>It’s kinda like we took our <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/4884\">RP2040 Feather</a> and <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/4984\">DVI Breakout board</a> and glued them together. You get all the pins for use on the Feather, the Lipoly battery support, USB C power / data, onboard NeoPixel, 8MB of FLASH for storing code and files, and then with the 8 unused pins, a DVI output that can be used with the <a href=\"https://github.com/adafruit/PicoDVI\">PicoDVI library in Arduino</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/Wren6991/PicoDVI\">Pico SDK</a> (note we don’t have Circuitpython support for DVI output at this time)</p><p>In Arduino, which is what we recommend, <a href=\"https://github.com/adafruit/PicoDVI\">we use our fork of PicoDVI</a> to create an internal framebuffer of 320x240 or 400x240 16-bit pixels that is then continuously blitted out as pixel-doubled 640x480 or 800x480 digital video. Whatever you ‘draw’ to the internal memory framebuffer appears instantly on the digital display in crisp color. Since the library is a subclass of AdafruitGFX, it’ll be familiar to folks who have used our TFT or OLED displays before.</p><p>Note that the DVI video generation uses one full core, both PIOs, and 150K (320x240) or 190K (400x240) of SRAM. It’s kinda maxed out so be aware of the remaining resource limitations.</p><p>We also connected the HDMI-connectors I2C pins to the SDA/SCL of the Feather (through a safe level shifter) so you can read the EDID EEPROM of displays, and have broken out the CEC and Utility pads. The Hot Plug Detect pin is also available on the very end of the 16-pin header. Read this pin to know when a display has been connected!</p><h2 id=\"purchase\">Purchase</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/5710\">Adafruit</a></li></ul>"

        "description": "<p>The Adafruit Feather series gives you lots of options for a small, portable, rechargeable microcontroller board. By picking a feather and stacking on a FeatherWing you can create advanced projects quickly. One popular combo is our <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/3857\">Feather M4</a> or <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/4884\">Feather RP2040</a> with a <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/3988\">Prop-Maker FeatherWing</a> on top to create animatronics or props that boot up instantly and can drive LEDs, and small speakers.</p><p>We’ve used the <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/3988\">Prop-Maker FeatherWing</a> to make lots of lil robots, swords, and other prop projects. However, what if we made it <em>even easier</em> for people to make props? What if we made it so many projects can be built with minimal or no soldering at all? Yeah that would be pretty nice!</p><p>Thus, the creation of the <strong>Adafruit RP2040 Prop-Maker Feather</strong>: an all-in-one combination of the <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/4884\">Feather RP2040</a> with a <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/3988\">Prop-Maker FeatherWing</a> with a few tweaks based on feedback from expert prop-builders. Perfect for fitting into your next prop build! This Feather will <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagineering\">unlock the ‘Imagineer’ inside all of us</a>, with tons of stuff packed in to make sabers &amp; swords, props, toys, mini robots, cosplay pieces, and more.</p><p>We looked at hundreds of prop builds, and thought about what would make for a great low-cost (but well-designed) add-on for our Feather boards. Here’s what we came up with:</p><ul>  <li><strong>Terminal Block NeoPixel Port -</strong> With easy-to-use screw terminals you can quickly connect and disconnect your NeoPixel strips and rings. This port provides high current drive from either the Feather Lipoly or USB port, whichever is higher. A 5V level up-shifter gives you a clean voltage signal to reduce glitchiness no matter what LED chip you’re using. You can also cut power to the entire strip instantly to reduce quiescent power, thanks to a separate control transistor. <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/category/168\">Works with any and all NeoPixels</a> (SK6812 / WS2812 family)</li>  <li><strong>MAX98357 I2S 3 Watt Class D Audio Amplifier</strong> - Drive any 4-8Ω speaker, up to 3 Watts, for sound effects. Audio comes out on two of the terminal blocks so you can screw in any wires to a speaker you like - <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/3968\">we’re partial to this small 3W speaker</a> or <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/4445\">this enclosed style 3W speaker</a>, both come with pre-attached wires. <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/3006\">Thanks to the I2S digital inputs</a>, you’ll get excellent audio quality</li>  <li><strong>Triple-Axis Accelerometer with Tap Detection</strong> - The LIS3DH is our favorite accelerometer, you can use this for detection motion, tilt, or taps. <a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/hallowing-lightsaber\">Here’s an example of a lightsaber that makes sounds when swung or hit.</a> We have code for this chip in both Arduino and CircuitPython.</li>  <li><strong>Extra Button or Output Pin</strong> - One more pin on the terminal screw block can be used for button input or digital output, for activation or a simple LED.</li>  <li><strong>Servo Connection</strong> - <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/search?q=servo\">Plug any hobby servo with 3 wires</a> into the 0.1” spaced header, and you can have quick motion control.</li>  <li><strong>Low power mode!</strong> The power system for the NeoPixels and speaker amplifier can be controlled by a pin to cut power to them, so you have lower power usage when the prop is in sleep or off mode (but can wake up fast by listening to the button press or accelerometer data).</li></ul><p>At the Feather’s heart is an RP2040 chip, clocked at 133 MHz and at 3.3V logic, the same one used in the <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/4864\">Raspberry Pi Pico</a>.

        "description": "<p>If there is one thing Adafruit is known for, its mega-blinky-fun-rainbow-LEDs. <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/category/168\">We just love sticking NeoPixels anywhere and everywhere</a>. When we saw the new ‘PIO’ peripheral on<a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/category/875\"> the RP2040 from Raspberry Pi</a>, we just knew it would be perfect for driving large quantities of NeoPixels. So we created this board, the <strong>Adafruit Feather RP2040 SCORPIO</strong>, designed specifically for NeoPixel (WS2812) driving but also good for various other PIO-based projects that want to take advantage of the Feather pinout with 8 separate consecutive outputs (or inputs).</p><p><a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/intro-to-rp2040-pio-with-circuitpython\">The RP2040 PIO state machine</a> is perfect for LED driving: it can generate perfect waveforms, with up to 8 outputs concurrently, all through DMA. That means that you don’t need to use any processor time to bit-bang-out the LED data. Just set up the buffer and tell the PIO peripheral to ‘make it so’ and it will shove that data to the 8 outputs without delay while your code can continue to read buttons, play music, run CircuitPython - whatever you like!</p><p>The SCORPIO has a clever pinout, where all the standard Feather pins are the same as the GPIO pins, plus the standard I2C, SPI and UART lines - and theres <em>still</em> enough pins left over to have 8 consecutive pins for PIO usage on GPIO16 through GPIO23 inclusive.</p><p>To make NeoPixel usage glitch-free there is a 3V-&gt;5V level shifter so that the output logic is 5V. If you happen to want 3V signals, you can adjust the shifter voltage with a jumper on the bottom. It’s also possible to flip the direction of the level shifter to make the 8 I/O pins inputs - say for making a logic analyzer - with a directional jumper selection also on the bottom of the PCB.</p><p>The RP2040 SCORPIO also has a <em>ton</em> of RAM, 264KB, making it trivial to buffer huge numbers of NeoPixels…<em>several thousand</em> if needed. In fact there’s so much RAM you can even <em>dither</em> the pixels to for finer brightness control, for better-looking LEDs at low brightness or for gamma correction.</p><p>We have <a href=\"https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPXL8\">NeoPXL8 driver code available in Arduino</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_NeoPxl8\">CircuitPython</a>, so you can jump immediately to making beautiful artworks driven by the Adafruit SCORPIO.</p><ul>  <li>Measures 2.0” x 0.9” x 0.28” (50.8mm x 22.8mm x 7mm) without headers soldered in</li>  <li>Light as a (large?) feather - 5 grams</li>  <li>RP2040 32-bit Cortex M0+ dual core running at ~125 MHz @ 3.3V logic and power</li>  <li>264 KB RAM</li>  <li><strong>8 MB SPI FLASH</strong> chip for storing files and CircuitPython/MicroPython code storage.

        "description": "<p>Easy e-paper and RP2040 finally come to your Feather with this Adafruit RP2040 Feather Think Ink that’s designed to make it a breeze to add almost any common e-Ink/e-Paper display. Chances are you’ve seen one of those new-fangled ‘e-readers’ like the Kindle or Nook. They have gigantic electronic paper ‘static’ displays - that means the image stays on the display even when power is completely disconnected. The image is also high contrast and very daylight readable. It really does look just like printed paper!</p><p>We’ve liked these displays for a long time, and we’ve got Arduino/CircuitPython drivers for tons of the various display chipsets, so wouldn’t an e-paper RP2040 Feather make a ton of sense? Luckily for us, just about every small-medium size EInk display made these days has a standard 24-pin connection. This Feather will add all the power supply support circuitry and level shifting so you can attach your favorite display - we’ve tested it with up to 5.6” sized 7-color ACeP displays.</p><p>Since all ePaper displays with the 24-pin interface require you to buffer the layers of data and write them all out at once over SPI, the RP2040 chip is an excellent driver. It has 264K of internal SRAM so even with the largest displays, there’s plenty of memory to store all the image data plus run your own code. We also put the display on it’s own SPI port so that the Feather’s main SPI port can be used for other peripheral devices.</p><p>Feather is the development board specification from Adafruit, and like its namesake, it is thin, light, and lets you fly! We designed Feather to be a new standard for portable microcontroller cores. We have other boards in the Feather family, check’em out here.</p><p>At the Feather’s heart is an RP2040 chip, clocked at 133 MHz and at 3.3V logic, the same one used in the Raspberry Pi Pico. This chip has a whopping MB of onboard QSPI FLASH and 264K of RAM!  There’s even room left over for a STEMMA QT connector for plug-and-play of I2C devices.</p><p>To make it easy to use for portable projects, we added a connector for any of our 3.7V Lithium polymer batteries and built-in battery charging. You don’t need a battery, it will run just fine straight from the USB Type C connector. But, if you do have a battery, you can take it on the go, then plug in the USB to recharge. The Feather will automatically switch over to USB power when it’s available. While the RP2040 is not designed for low power usage - you can get down to about 1.5mA of power draw in sleep mode.</p><p>Here’re some handy specs! You get:</p><ul>  <li>Measures 2.0” x 0.9” x 0.28” (50.8mm x 22.8mm x 7mm) without headers soldered in</li>  <li>Light as a (large?) feather - 6.3 grams</li>  <li>RP2040 32-bit Cortex M0+ dual core running at ~133 MHz @ 3.3V logic and power</li>  <li>264 KB RAM</li>  <li>8 MB SPI FLASH chip for storing files, images and CircuitPython/MicroPython code storage. No EEPROM</li>  <li>Tons of GPIO! 21 x GPIO pins with following capabilities:    <ul>      <li>Four 12-bit ADCs (one more than Pico)</li>      <li>Two I2C, Two SPI, and two UART peripherals, we label one for the ‘main’ interface in standard Feather locations</li>      <li>16 x PWM outputs - for servos, LEDs, etc</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Built-in 200mA+ lipoly charger with charging status indicator LED</li>  <li>Pin #13 red LED for general purpose blinking</li>  <li>RGB NeoPixel for full-color indication.</li>  <li>On-board STEMMA QT connector that lets you quickly connect any Qwiic, STEMMA QT or Grove I2C devices with no soldering!</li>  <li>Both Reset button and Bootloader select button for quick restarts (no unplugging-replugging to relaunch code)</li>  <li>USB Type C connector lets you access built-in ROM USB bootloader and serial port debugging</li>  <li>3.3V regulator with 500mA peak current output and power enable pin</li>  <li>4 mounting holes</li>  <li>12 MHz crystal for perfect timing.</li>  <li>Support circuitry for common 24-pin e-Paper/e-Ink displays. These tend to be 1.54” to 7” diagonal and designed for ‘smart labels’. No soldering required, simply plug in the display to the FPC connector on the end and load up your code. Not for use with the larger resolution displays on e-Readers like Kindles. Those use a different interface!</li></ul><h2 id=\"purchase\">Purchase</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/5727\">Adafruit</a></li></ul>"

        "description": "<p>You’re probably really used to microcontroller boards with USB, but what about a dev board with two? Two is more than one, so that makes it twice as good! And the Adafruit Feather RP2040 with USB Host is definitely double-the-fun of our other Feather RP2040 boards, with a USB Type A port on the end for connecting USB devices to.</p><p>Now you might be thinking “hey waitaminute, the RP2040 doesn’t have two USB port peripherals???” and you’d be correct! But what it does have is a nifty PIO peripheral that can be (ab)used to emulate a USB host peripheral. You get to keep the main USB port for uploading, debugging, and data communication, while at the same time sending and receiving data to just-about-any USB device. This work is originally by sekigon on GitHub, and if you’re using Pico SDK that’s still the recommended library to use.</p><p>Currently, support for the USB Host peripheral is only in Arduino. So check out the TinyUSB ‘dual role’ examples for some things you can do! For example, datalogging to a USB Key. Or reading from another device/microcontroller that has USB CDC serial interface. Or creating an HID re-mapper. Or connecting to weird devices that require firmware-updates like the Cypress EZ-USB based Intellikeys communications board.</p><h2 id=\"tutorials\">Tutorials</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-rp2040-with-usb-type-a-host\">Primary Guide: Adafruit Feather RP2040 with USB Type A Host</a></li></ul><h2 id=\"purchase\">Purchase</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/5723\">Adafruit</a></li></ul>"

        "description": "<p>RP2350 flies high with the Feather format - now you can use any FeatherWings with this battery-powered dev board. It comes with 8MB of flash, 22pin HSTX output port, Stemma QT, debug SWD, and optional PSRAM spot. It’s our first RP2350 board and we crammed a ton of goodies into our classic Feather format. It’s an excellent starter board to go along with your Pico 2.</p><p>The RP2350 is Raspberry Pi’s second microcontroller chip following their breakout-hit the RP2040. Building on their success, the RP2350 upgrades the dual M0 core to dual M33 cores with 150 MHz clock rate. The M33 is a much newer Arm chipset, we’ve found that firmware runs about twice as fast. Especially given that we now have hardware floating point support. Also, the RP2350 has twice as much SRAM: 520KB instead of 264KB which means that micropython/circuitpython runs great and also IoT projects that need a lot of memory buffer space will run better. Other improvements include, 3 PIO blocks instead of 2, TrustZone secure boot, and a special High Speed Transmit (HSTX) peripheral that drives 4 lanes of differential data transmission such as DVI output without needing to overclock or use PIO.</p><p>For peripherals, there are two I2C controllers, two SPI controllers, and two UARTs that are multiplexed across the GPIO - check the pinout for what pins can be set to which. There are 24 PWM channels, each pin has a channel it can be set to (ditto on the pinout).</p><p>Feather RP2350 HSTX Specifications:</p><ul>  <li>Measures 2.0” x 0.9” x 0.28” (50.8mm x 22.8mm x 7mm) without headers soldered in</li>  <li>Light as a (large?) feather - 5 grams</li>  <li>RP2350 32-bit Cortex M33 dual core running at 150 MHz @ 3.3V logic and power</li>  <li>520 KB RAM + 8 KB OTP memory</li>  <li>8 MB SPI FLASH chip for storing files and CircuitPython/MicroPython code storage. No EEPROM</li>  <li>Optional spot for SOIC PSRAM chip with chip select line on GPIO 8</li>  <li>Tons of GPIO! 29 x GPIO pins with following capabilities:    <ul>      <li>21 GPIO available on the Feather header pins, 8 more ‘consecutive’ GPIO available on the HSTX connector (you don’t have to use them with the HSTX peripheral)</li>      <li>Four 12-bit ADCs (one more than Pico 2)</li>      <li>Two I2C, Two SPI, and two UART peripherals, we label one for the ‘main’ interface in standard Feather locations</li>      <li>24 x PWM outputs - for servos, LEDs, etc</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Built-in 200mA+ lipoly charger with charging status indicator LED. For non-rechargeable battery usage the charger can be disabled by cutting a jumper trace on the back.</li>  <li>Pin #7 red LED for general purpose blinking</li>  <li>RGB NeoPixel for full-color indication.</li>  <li>On-board STEMMA QT connector that lets you quickly connect any Qwiic, STEMMA QT or Grove I2C devices with no soldering!</li>  <li>Both Reset button and Bootloader select button for quick restarts (no unplugging-replugging to relaunch code)</li>  <li>3.3V Power/enable pin</li>  <li>Pico Probe 3-pin JST SH connector for SWD debugging</li>  <li>4 mounting holes</li>  <li>12 MHz crystal for perfect timing.</li>  <li>3.3V regulator with 500mA peak current output</li>  <li>USB Type C connector lets you access built-in ROM USB bootloader and serial port debugging</li></ul><p>Inside the RP2350 is a ‘permanent ROM’ USB UF2 bootloader. What that means is when you want to program new firmware, you can hold down the BOOTSEL button while plugging it into USB (or pulling down the RUN/Reset pin to ground) and it will appear as a USB disk drive you can drag the firmware onto. Folks who have been using Adafruit products will find this very familiar - we use the technique on all our native-USB boards. Just note you don’t double-click reset instead hold down BOOTSEL during boot to enter the bootloader!</p><p>There is great C/C++ support, unofficial (but really good) Arduino support, an official MicroPython port, and a CircuitPython port! We of course recommend CircuitPython because we think it’s the easiest way to get started and it has support with most of our drivers, displays, sensors, and more, supported out of the box so you can follow along with our CircuitPython projects and tutorials.</p><p>While the RP2350 has lots of onboard RAM, it does not have built-in FLASH memory. Instead, that is provided by the external QSPI flash chip. On this board there is 8 MB, which is shared between the program it’s running and any file storage used by MicroPython or CircuitPython. When using C/C++ you get the whole flash memory, if using Python you will have about 7 MB remaining for code, files, images, fonts, etc.</p><p>RP2350 Chip features:</p><ul>  <li>Dual ARM Cortex-M33 with floating point unit or Dual RISC-V @ 150MHz</li>  <li>520 kB on-chip SRAM</li>  <li>8 kB of one-time-programmable (OTP) memory.</li>  <li>Support for up to 16MB of off-chip Flash memory via dedicated QSPI bus</li>  <li>Support for external QSPI PSRAM</li>  <li>DMA controller, 16 channel, 4 IRQ</li>  <li>Fully-connected AHB crossbar</li>  <li>On-chip switched-mode power supply and programmable low-dropout regulator (LDO) to generate core voltage</li>  <li>Two on-chip PLLs to generate 48 MHz USB and 150MHz core clocks</li>  <li>Optional boot signing with protected OTP storage</li>  <li>Hardware SHA-256 accelerator</li>  <li>Hardware random number generator (TRNG)</li>  <li>30 GPIO pins, 4 of which can be used as analog inputs</li>  <li>Peripherals    <ul>      <li>2 UARTs</li>      <li>2 SPI controllers</li>      <li>2 I2C controllers</li>      <li>24 PWM channels (compared to 16 on RP2040)</li>      <li>USB 1.1 controller and PHY, with host and device support</li>      <li>12 PIO state machines</li>    </ul>  </li></ul><p>Please note: The Adafruit Feather RP2350 HSTX comes with the A2 version of the RP2350, which is affected by the E9 erratum. This errata affects some uses of GPIO and PIO such as high-impedance inputs and the internal pulldowns. You may need to use 8.2K or smaller resistors if pull-downs are required. At this time, Sept 9 2024, there is no other version of the RP2350 available - only the A2 version.</p>"

This breakout is basically the ‘big sister’ of our HUZZAH 8266, but instead of an ESP8266 it has the ‘32! We’ve pared down our popular <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405\">Feather ESP32</a>, removing the battery charger and USB-serial converter. You just get a regulator, some protection diodes, two buttons and an LED. For some projects, where price and size are at a premium, you can program this board over the ‘FTDI cable’ breakout when needed, and leave it alone otherwise.</p><p>Note that this board <em>doesn’t</em> come with a USB to serial converter chip and auto-reset circuit. Instead, you will need to plug in a <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/3309\">CP2104 Friend</a> or <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/70\">FTDI cable</a>. Then, before uploading code, put it into bootloader mode by holding down the GPIO #0 button and clicking Reset button, then releasing the #0 button.</p><p>That module in the middle of the breakout contains a dual-core ESP32 chip, 4 MB of SPI Flash, tuned antenna, and all the passives you need to take advantage of this powerful new processor. The ESP32 has both WiFi <em>and</em> Bluetooth Classic/LE support. That means it’s perfect for just about any wireless or Internet-connected project.</p><p>The ESP32 is a perfect upgrade from the ESP8266 that has been so popular. In comparison, the ESP32 has way more GPIO, plenty of analog inputs, two analog outputs, multiple extra peripherals (like a spare UART), two cores so you don’t have to yield to the WiFi manager, much higher-speed processor, etc. etc!</p><p>Comes fully assembled and tested, pre-programmed with ESP32 SPI WiFi co-processor firmware that <a href=\"https://github.com/ladyada/Adafruit_CircuitPython_ESP32SPI\">you can use in CircuitPython to use this into a WiFi co-processsor over SPI + 2 pins</a>.

        "description": "<p>A new chip means a new ItsyBitsy, and the Raspberry Pi RP2040 is no exception. When we saw this chip we thought “this chip is going to be awesome when we give it the ItsyBitsy teensy-weensy Treatment” and so we did! This Itsy’ features the RP2040, and all niceties you know and love about the <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/category/1008\">ItsyBitsy family</a>.</p><p>What’s smaller than a Feather but larger than a Trinket? It’s an Adafruit ItsyBitsy RP2040 featuring the Raspberry Pi RP2040! Small, powerful, with a ultra fast duel Cortex M0+ processor running at 125 MHz - this microcontroller board is perfect when you want something very compact, with lots of horsepower and a bunch of pins. This Itsy has sports car speed, but SUV roominess with 4 MB of FLASH and 264 KB of SRAM.</p><p>ItsyBitsy RP2040 is only 1.4” long by 0.7” wide, but has 6 power pins, 23 digital GPIO pins (4 of which can be analog in and 16x PWM out). It’s the same chip as the <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/products/4884\">Feather RP2040</a> and <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/products/4883\">Raspberry Pi Pico</a> <em>but really really small</em>. So it’s great once you’ve finished up a prototype, and want to make the project much smaller. It even comes with 4MB of SPI Flash built in, for data logging, file storage, or CircuitPython/MicroPython code.</p><h2 id=\"technical-details\">Technical details</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/category/1008\">Same size and form-factor as the rest of the ItsyBitsy family</a> and nearly-identical pinout</li>  <li>Measures 1.4” x 0.7” x 0.2” (36 mm x 18 mm x 4 mm) without headers soldered in</li>  <li>RP2040 32-bit Cortex M0+ dual core running at ~125 MHz @ 3.3 V logic and power</li>  <li>264 KB RAM</li>  <li><strong>4 MB SPI FLASH</strong> chip for storing files and CircuitPython/MicroPython code storage. No EEPROM</li>  <li>23 GPIO pins with following capabilities:    <ul>      <li>4 12 bit ADCs (one more than Pico)</li>      <li>2 I2C, 2 SPI and 2 UART peripherals, we label one for the ‘main’ interface in standard ItsyBitsy locations</li>      <li>16 PWM outputs - for servos, LEDs, etc</li>      <li>The 10 digital ‘non-ADC/non-peripheral’ GPIO are consecutive for maximum PIO compatibility</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li><strong>Pin #13 red LED</strong> for general purpose blinking</li>  <li><strong>RGB NeoPixel</strong> with power pin on GPIO so you can depower it for low power usages.</li>  <li><strong>Both Reset button and Bootloader select button for quick restarts (no unplugging-replugging to relaunch code)</strong></li>  <li>3.3 V regulator with 500mA peak current output</li>  <li>3.3 V Power/enable pin</li>  <li>Power with either USB or external output (such as a battery) - it’ll automatically switch over</li>  <li>Broken-out SWD pins for debug access</li>  <li>24 MHz crystal for perfect timing.</li>  <li>Special <strong>Vhigh</strong> output pin gives you the higher voltage from VBAT or VUSB, for driving NeoPixels, servos, and other 5V-logic devices. <strong>Digital 5</strong> level-shifted output for high-voltage logic level output.</li>  <li><strong>USB Micro B connector</strong> lets you access built-in ROM USB bootloader and serial port debugging</li></ul><p><strong>Inside the RP2040 is a ‘permanent ROM’ USB UF2 bootloader</strong>. What that means is when you want to program new firmware, you can hold down the BOOTSEL button while plugging it into USB (or pulling down the RUN/Reset pin to ground) and it will appear as a USB disk drive you can drag the firmware onto. Folks who have been using Adafruit products will find this very familiar - we use the technique on all our native-USB boards. Just note you don’t double-click reset, instead hold down BOOTSEL during boot to enter the bootloader!</p><p>The RP2040 is a powerful chip, which has the clock speed of our M4 (SAMD51), and two cores that are equivalent to our M0 (SAMD21). Since it is an M0 chip, it does not have a floating point unit or DSP hardware support - so if you’re doing something with heavy floating point math, it will be done in software and thus not as fast as an M4. For many other computational tasks, you’ll get close-to-M4 speeds!</p><p>For peripherals, there are two I2C controllers, two SPI controllers, and two UARTs that are multiplexed across the GPIO - check the pinout for what pins can be set to which. There are 16 PWM channels, each pin has a channel it can be set to (ditto on the pinout).</p><p>You’ll note there’s no I2S peripheral, or SDIO, or camera, what’s up with that? Well instead of having specific hardware support for serial-data-like peripherals like these, the RP2040 comes with the PIO state machine system which is a unique and powerful way to create <em>custom hardware logic and data processing blocks</em> that run on their own without taking up a CPU. For example, NeoPixels - often we bitbang the timing-specific protocol for these LEDs. For the RP2040, we instead use PIO object that reads in the data buffer and clocks out the right bitstream with perfect accuracy. <a href=\"https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/tree/master/pio\">Same with I2S audio in or out, LED matrix displays, 8-bit or SPI based TFTs, even VGA</a>! In MicroPython and CircuitPython you can create PIO control commands to script the peripheral and load it in at runtime. There are 2 PIO peripherals with 4 state machines each.</p><p><strong>At the time of launch, there is no Arduino core support for this board. There is great <a href=\"https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk\">C/C++ support</a>, an official <a href=\"https://github.com/raspberrypi/micropython\">MicroPython port</a>, and a <a href=\"https://circuitpython.org/downloads\">CircuitPython port</a>!</strong> We of course <a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython\">recommend CircuitPython because we think it’s the easiest way to get started</a> and it has support with most of our drivers, displays, sensors, and more, supported out of the box so you can follow along with our CircuitPython projects and tutorials.</p><p>This Itsy comes with loose 0.1” headers you can solder in for breadboard use!</p><p>While the RP2040 has lots of onboard RAM (264 KB), it does not have built-in FLASH memory. Instead, that is provided by the external QSPI flash chip. On this board there is 2 MB, which is shared between the program it’s running and any file storage used by MicroPython or CircuitPython. When using C/C++ you get the whole flash memory, if using Python you will have about 1 MB remaining for code, files, images, fonts, etc.</p><p><strong>RP2040 Chip features:</strong></p><ul>  <li>Dual ARM Cortex-M0+ @ 133 MHz</li>  <li>264 kB on-chip SRAM in six independent banks</li>  <li>Support for up to 16MB of off-chip Flash memory via dedicated QSPI bus</li>  <li>DMA controller</li>  <li>Fully-connected AHB crossbar</li>  <li>Interpolator and integer divider peripherals</li>  <li>On-chip programmable LDO to generate core voltage</li>  <li>2 on-chip PLLs to generate USB and core clocks</li>  <li>30 GPIO pins, 4 of which can be used as analog inputs</li>  <li>Peripherals    <ul>      <li>2 UARTs</li>      <li>2 SPI controllers</li>      <li>2 I2C controllers</li>      <li>16 PWM channels</li>      <li>USB 1.1 controller and PHY, with host and device support</li>      <li>8 PIO state machines</li>    </ul>  </li></ul><h2 id=\"purchase\">Purchase</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/4888\">Adafruit</a></li></ul>"

(#keeblife 4 evah) A lot of folks like using Adafruit parts for their Keeb builds – but with the ItsyBitsy not being pin-compatible with the Pro Micro pinout, it really wasn’t very easy without some sort of adapter plate.</p><p>Now we’re seeing lots of people use CircuitPython for keebs, which is awesome! So why not try our hands at spinning up a pro-micro-compatible RP2040 board? The RP2040 is plenty powerful, low-cost, and makes for an excellent keeb driver chip.</p><p>We mixed together what we liked most about the SparkFun Pro Micro RP2040 (<strong>Qwiic / STEMMA QT I2C port on the end</strong>, so good!) and Elite-C (<strong>castellated pads &amp; pins for D+ and D-</strong>) and our existing RP2040 boards (<strong>boot button can be used for user, 8MB QSPI flash, onboard NeoPixel, jumper for skipping the diode/fuse for high power RGB LEDs or USB hosting</strong>). We even got it to all fit on a 2-layer PCB with 7/7 routing – just needed to make the smallest caps and resistors 0402.</p><p>With 20 GPIO available (18 on castellated pins, 2 on STEMMA QT port) you can easily make up to 100-keys matrices, or common 65% 5x15 layouts. <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/4209\">Use a plug-and-play QT cable to connect to the last two pins</a> without having to do any desoldering/rework.</p><h2 id=\"technical-details\">Technical details</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12640\">Same size and form-factor as a Pro Micro breakout</a> and nearly-identical pinout (this board has fewer analog pins, for example)</li>  <li>Measures 1.3” x 0.7” without headers soldered in</li>  <li>RP2040 32-bit Cortex M0+ dual core running at ~125 MHz @ 3.3 V logic and power. 264 KB RAM, No EEPROM. 12 MHz crystal for perfect timing.</li>  <li><strong>8 MB SPI FLASH</strong> chip for storing files and CircuitPython/MicroPython code storage.</li>  <li>20 GPIO pins with following capabilities:    <ul>      <li>18 GPIO on castellated/pin breakout pads. 2 GPIO on QT port that can be easily accessed for 5x15 keyboard layouts.</li>      <li>4 12 bit ADCs</li>      <li>2 I2C, 2 SPI and 2 UART peripherals, we label one of for the ‘main’ interface in standard Pro Micro locations</li>      <li>16 PWM outputs - for servos, LEDs, etc</li>      <li>The 10 digital non-ADC GPIO are consecutive for maximum PIO compatibility</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li><strong>RGB NeoPixel</strong> for colorful status indiction</li>  <li>Classic <strong>green power LED</strong></li>  <li>Both Reset button and Bootloader select button for quick restarts.

That said, it’s a perfectly good stand-alone development board for the Nordic nRF52840 chipset, with a very slim design, optional LiPo battery support, a few sensors, and a Stemma QT port for adding other devices or sensors with I2C plug-and-play.</p><p>The driver <em>looks</em> a little like a Feather but it does not have any breakout pins to keep it very compact. If you need access to GPIO pins, we recommend an <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/4481\">nRF52840 ItsyBitsy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/4062\">nRF52840 Feather</a> or <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/4516\">Feather Sense</a>.</p><p>In exchange for GPIO outputs, we added some sensors on instead: each board <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/2809\">comes with a LIS3DH triple-axis accelerometer</a> that can be used for motion and orientation sensing, <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/3492\">and a PDM digital microphone</a> for audio sensing. To add more sensors or connect to the LED Glasses front panel, there’s a <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/category/1018\">STEMMA QT connector for plug-and-play I2C support</a>.</p><p>Unlike our Itsy/Feather boards, this driver also comes with a proper on/off switch which will cut power to the microcontroller and external sensors. There’s optional LiPo charge support because we think that many folks will want to power this board with AAA or coin cell batteries. If you’d like to enable LiPo charging, short the jumper on the back and then make sure to only use 4.2 V/3.7 V rechargeable batteries in the battery port.</p><p>The nRF52840 is a lovely Bluetooth LE microcontroller, with good support in both Arduino and CircuitPython. It feathers a Cortex M4 processor with 1 MB of FLASH and 256 KB of SRAM. Best of all, it’s got that native USB! Finally, no need for a separate USB serial chip like CP2104 or FT232. Serial is handled as a USB CDC descriptor, and the chip can act like a keyboard, mouse, MIDI device or even disk drive. <a href=\"https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_TinyUSB_Arduino\">This chip has TinyUSB support</a> - that means you can use it with Arduino as a native USB device and act as UART (CDC), HID, Mass Storage, MIDI and more!</p><h2 id=\"technical-details\">Technical details</h2><ul>  <li>ARM Cortex M4F (with HW floating point acceleration) running at 64 MHz</li>  <li>1 MB flash and 256 KB SRAM</li>  <li>Bluetooth Low Energy compatible 2.4GHz radio (Details available in the <a href=\"https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Low-power-short-range-wireless/nRF52840\">nRF52840</a> product specification)</li>  <li>FCC/IC/TELEC certified module with up to +8 dBm output power</li>  <li>2 MB external QSPI flash for CircuitPython file storage</li>  <li>Built in LIS3DH accelerometer and PDM microphone</li>  <li>Red LED for general purpose blinking, plus a tiny NeoPixel for colorful feedback</li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/category/1018\">STEMMA QT connector for plug-and-play I2C support</a>.</li>  <li>JST PH 2-pin battery port with optional LiPoly charger</li>  <li>4 mounting holes/slots</li>  <li>Reset button and User button</li>  <li>Native USB supported by every OS - can be used in Arduino or CircuitPython as USB serial console, Keyboard/Mouse HID, even a little disk drive for storing Python scripts.</li>  <li>Can be used with Arduino IDE or CircuitPython</li>  <li>Comes pre-loaded with the <a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-metro-m0-express-designed-for-circuitpython/uf2-bootloader\">UF2 bootloader</a>, which looks like a USB storage key.

Thus a DPDT switch: flip one way to have the GPIO go in order of 0-7, flip the other way to have the logical locations of the hardware UART correct but now the pin order is 1, 0, 2, 3..7. Of course, it’s also handy if, like us, you often swap the pins - now you don’t need to require or cut/solder traces!</p><h3 id=\"about-the-rp2040\"><strong>About the RP2040</strong></h3><p>The RP2040 is a powerful chip, which has the clock speed of our M4 (SAMD51), and two cores that are equivalent to our M0 (SAMD21). Since it is an M0 chip, it does not have a floating point unit or DSP hardware support - so if you’re doing something with heavy floating-point math, it will be done in software and thus not as fast as an M4. For many other computational tasks, you’ll get close-to-M4 speeds!</p><p>For peripherals, there are two I2C controllers, two SPI controllers, and two UARTs that are multiplexed across the GPIO - check the pinout for what pins can be set to which. There are 16 PWM channels, each pin has a channel it can be set to (ditto on the pinout).</p><p>You’ll note there’s no I2S peripheral, or SDIO, or camera, what’s up with that? Well, instead of having specific hardware support for serial-data-like peripherals like these, the RP2040 comes with the PIO state machine system, which is a unique and powerful way to create <em>custom hardware logic and data processing blocks</em> that run on their own without taking up a CPU. For example, NeoPixels - often we bitbang the timing-specific protocol for these LEDs. For the RP2040, we instead use PIO object that reads in the data buffer and clocks out the right bitstream with perfect accuracy. <a href=\"https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/tree/master/pio\">Same with I2S audio in or out, LED matrix displays, 8-bit or SPI based TFTs, even VGA</a>! In MicroPython and CircuitPython, you can create PIO control commands to script the peripheral and load it in at runtime. There are 2 PIO peripherals with 4 state machines each.</p><p><strong>There is great <a href=\"https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk\">C/C++ support</a>, <a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/rp2040-arduino-with-the-earlephilhower-core\">unofficial (but really good) Arduino support,</a> an official <a href=\"https://github.com/micropython/micropython\">MicroPython port</a>, and a <a href=\"https://circuitpython.org/downloads\">CircuitPython port</a>!</strong> We, of course, <a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython\">recommend CircuitPython because we think it’s the easiest way to get started</a>, and it has support with most of our drivers, displays, sensors, and more, supported out of the box so you can follow along with our CircuitPython projects and tutorials.</p><p>While the RP2040 has lots of onboard RAM (264KB), it does not have built-in FLASH memory. Instead, that is provided by the external QSPI flash chip. <strong>On this board, there is 16 MB</strong>, which is shared between the program it’s running and any file storage used by MicroPython or CircuitPython.

What that means is when you want to program new firmware, you can hold down the BOOT button while plugging it into USB (or pulling down the RUN/Reset pin to ground) and it will appear as a USB disk drive you can drag the firmware onto. Folks who have been using Adafruit products will find this very familiar - we use the technique on all our native-USB boards. Just note you don’t double-click reset, instead hold down BOOTSEL during boot to enter the bootloader!</p><p>The RP2040 is a powerful chip, which has the clock speed of our M4 (SAMD51), and two cores that are equivalent to our M0 (SAMD21). Since it is an M0 chip, it does not have a floating point unit or DSP hardware support - so if you’re doing something with heavy floating point math, it will be done in software and thus not as fast as an M4. For many other computational tasks, you’ll get close-to-M4 speeds!</p><p>For peripherals, there are two I2C controllers, two SPI controllers, and two UARTs that are multiplexed across the GPIO - check the pinout for what pins can be set to which. There are 16 PWM channels, each pin has a channel it can be set to (ditto on the pinout).</p><p>You’ll note there’s no I2S peripheral, or SDIO, or camera, what’s up with that? Well, instead of having specific hardware support for serial-data-like peripherals like these, the RP2040 comes with the PIO state machine system which is a unique and powerful way to create <em>custom hardware logic and data processing blocks</em> that run on their own without taking up a CPU. For example, NeoPixels - often we bitbang the timing-specific protocol for these LEDs. For the RP2040, we instead use PIO object that reads in the data buffer and clocks out the right bitstream with perfect accuracy. <a href=\"https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/tree/master/pio\">Same with I2S audio in or out, LED matrix displays, 8-bit or SPI based TFTs, even VGA</a>! In MicroPython and CircuitPython you can create PIO control commands to script the peripheral and load it in at runtime. There are 2 PIO peripherals with 4 state machines each.</p><h2 id=\"purchase\">Purchase</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/4900\">Adafruit</a></li></ul>"

        "description": "<p>There’s a few things everyone loves: ice cream, kittens, and honkin’ large TFT screens. We’re no strangers to small TFT’s - <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/search?q=1.14+tft\">from our itsy 1.14” color display</a> that graces many-a-TFT-Feather to <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/2050\">our fancy 3.5” 320x480</a> breakout screen. But most people who dabble or engineer with microcontrollers know that you sort of ‘top out’ at 320x480 - that’s the largest resolution you can use with every day SPI or 8-bit 8080 interfaces. After that, you’re in TTL-interface TFT land, where displays no longer have an internal memory buffer and instead the controller has to continuously write scanline data over a 16 or 18 or 24 pin interface.</p><p>RGB TTL interface TFT displays can get big: they start out at around 4.3” diagonal 480x272, and can get to 800x480, 800x600 or even 720x720. For displays that big, you need a lot of video RAM (800x480 at 24 bit color is just over 1MB), plenty of spare GPIO to dedicate, and a peripheral that will DMA the video RAM out to the display continuously. This is a setup familiar to people working with hefty microcontrollers or microcomputers, the sort of device that run cell phones, or your car’s GPS navigation screen. But until now, nearly impossible to use on low cost microcontrollers.</p><p>The ESP32-S3 is the first low-cost microcontroller that has a built in peripheral that can drive TTL displays, and can come with enough PSRAM to buffer those large images. For example, on the <strong>Adafruit Qualia ESP32-S3 for TTL RGB-666 Displays</strong>, we use a S3 module with 16 MB of Flash and 8 MB of octal PSRAM. Using the built in RGB display peripheral you can display graphics, images, animations or even video (cinepak, natch!) with near-instantaneous updates since the whole screen gets updated every ~30FPS.</p><p>This dev board is designed to make it easy for you to explore displays that use the “secondary standard’ 40-pin RGB-666 connector. This pin order is most commonly seen on square, round and bar displays. <a href=\"https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/product-files/5792/Specification_TL021WVC02CT-B1323B.pdf\">You’ll want to compare the display you’re using to this datasheet</a>, if it matches you’ll probably be good! One nice thing about this connector ordering is that it also includes pins for capacitive touch overlay, and we wire those up to the ESP32-S3’s I2C port so you can also have touch control with your display.</p><p><strong>Don’t forget! This is just the development board, a display is not included.</strong> Use any RGB-666 pinout display with or without a touch overlay. Note that you will need to program in the driver initialization code, dimensions, and pulse widths in your programming language. Here are some known-working displays that you can use in Arduino or CircuitPython:</p><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/5792\">2.1” 480x480 Round with Capacitive Touch</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/5806\">2.1” 480x480 Round without touch</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/5794\">4” 720x720 Square with Capacitive Touch</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/5793\">4” 720x720 Round without touch</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/5805\">4.6” 960x320 Rectangular Bar</a></li></ul><p>On the Qualia board we have the S3 modules, with 16 pins connected to the TFT for 5-6-5 RGB color, plus HSync, VSync, Data Enable and Pixel Clock. There’s a constant current backlight control circuit using the <a href=\"https://www.ti.com/product/TPS61169/part-details/TPS61169DCKR\">TPS61169</a> which can get up to 30V forward voltage and can be configured for 25mA-200mA in 25mA increments (default is 25mA). Power and programming is provided over a USB C connector, wired to the S3’s native USB port. For debugging, the hardware UART TX pin is available as well.</p><p>Since almost every GPIO is used, and almost all RGB-666 displays need to be initialized over SPI, we put a <a href=\"https://www.ti.com/product/PCA9554\">PCA9554</a> I/O expander on the shared I2C bus. Arduino or CircuitPython can be instructed on how to use the expander to reset and init the display you have if necessary. The remaining expander pins are connected to two right-angle buttons, and the display backlight.</p><p>The expander is what lets us have a full 4-pin SPI port and two more analog GPIO pins - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjw-bCQ-lQ\">enough to wire up an MMC in 1-wire SDIO mode along with an I2S amplifier to make an A/V playback demo</a>. Maybe we can even eat ice cream while watching kitten vids! There is also the shared I2C port, we provide a Stemma QT / Qwiic port for easy addition of any sensor or device you like.</p><h2 id=\"purchase\">Purchase:</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/5800\">Adafruit</a></li></ul>"

On the TRRS Trinkey, we connect all 6 pins of a ‘switched’ TRRS jack - tip, ring 1, ring 2, sleeve and the tip switch plus ring 1 switch - to 6 GPIO pins on the microcontroller. That means we can not only detect when plugs are inserted but can change which pins are input, ground or even 3V power. With the use of a stereo/mic splitter, we can have up to 3 simple switches, or two analog potentiometers, or one of each! We particularly like this jack because it has two through-hole contacts near the opening for a good mechanical connection.</p><p>The PCB is designed to plug into any USB A port on a computer or laptop. There’s an ATSAMD21 microcontroller on board with just enough circuitry to keep it happy. One pin of the microcontroller connects to a NeoPixel LED. A reset button lets you enter bootloader mode if necessary. The microcontroller can be programmed easily thanks to the UF2 bootloader and CircuitPython: simply drag-n-drop new code on.</p><p>The SAMD21 can run CircuitPython or Arduino nicely. Over the USB connection, you can have serial, MIDI, or HID keyboard/mouse connectivity. Because its a fully programmable chip, it’s possible to customize the keyboard or mouse commands executed on each button, or even set up chording patterns.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul>  <li><strong>ATSAMD21E18 32-bit Cortex M0+</strong> - 48 MHz 32-bit processor with 256KB Flash and 32 KB RAM</li>  <li><strong>Native USB supported by every OS</strong> - can be used in Arduino or CircuitPython as a USB serial console, MIDI, Keyboard/Mouse HID, and even a little disk drive for storing Python scripts. Can act like a keyboard to phones or tablets with a USB adapter cable.</li>  <li>Can be used with <strong>Arduino IDE</strong> or <strong>CircuitPython</strong></li>  <li><strong>TRRS Jack</strong> with two switches on tip and ring 1. All 6 contacts connect to analog-input capable GPIO pins</li>  <li>One <strong>RGB NeoPixel LED</strong></li>  <li><strong>STEMMA QT port with JST SH 4-pin compatible connector</strong> - can be used to add I2C devices, or two more inputs. Note CircuitPython may not have enough memory for large chip drivers.</li>  <li><strong>Reset switch</strong> to start your project code over or enter bootloader mode</li>  <li><strong>Open Source Hardware</strong> so you have full control over your assistive tech!</li></ul><h2 id=\"purchase\">Purchase</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/5954\">Adafruit</a></li></ul>"

Notable examples include Thonny, ampy, pyboard, and Windows version of Python itself*</p><p>* The work-around for Windows python is to first create the serial port object, without specifying which port to use - this bypasses the Python windows bug which always sets the RTS/DTR pins.  You can then tell the serial object which port, and set the RTS/DTR pins as you like.</p><h2 id=\"circuitpython-on-esp32\">CircuitPython on ESP32</h2><p>Want to learn how to load circuitpython onto this board? check out <a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-with-esp32-quick-start/\">this</a> on the Adafruit learning system</p><h2 id=\"purchase\">Purchase</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-esp32%2525252dcam.html\">Aliexpress</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=esp32-cam\">Amazon</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=esp32-cam\">eBay</a></li></ul>"

Users can map keys, set LED colors, configure rotary encoders, create OLED images, and much more all from within an easy to use visual program (GUI). Many of Peg’s features and configuration options are unavailable through any other flashing program built for yesterday’s ATmega32U4 processors. Now, deep configuration and rich features custom keyboards offer can be configured easily instead of becoming another project. On the other hand, users who enjoy in-the-editor programming, product development, design, or any other roll your solution will similarly love the Blok. Shipping with KMK and CircuitPython out of the box, Blok’s offer enthusiasts and creators a modern development environment limited only by your imagination instead of programming knowledge and hardware constraints. Create your entire keymap in Python within a single main.py file and test your changes instantly, no recompiling necessary. Remember, if this isn’t your thing — Peg can handle it for you.</p><p>Built on top of a powerful RP2040 ARM microprocessor and designed with the future in mind, Blok’s handle whatever you throw at them. Compared to older ATmega based controllers Blok’s have an incredible 100x the RAM, 8x the computing speed, 500x the ROM, are 32 bit instead of 8 bit, and are dual-core instead of single core. These are huge upgrades and allows for innovation and development within the custom keyboard space.

Not to mention that the 8 MByte of FLASH memory will let you install any (or all) CircuitPython support libraries that you will ever need.</p><h3 id=\"technical-details\">Technical details</h3><ul>  <li>Raspberry Pi Pico Dual Core Cortex-M0 @ 133 MHz</li>  <li>8 MByte FLASH Memory</li>  <li>264 KByte SRAM Memory</li>  <li>1 Hardware I2C channel</li>  <li>1 Hardware SPI channel</li>  <li>1 Hardware UART for the user (Serial1)</li>  <li>1 Hardware UART connected to the network processor (Serial2 @ 1 Mbit/s)</li>  <li>12 Bit ADC.</li>  <li>SARA-R410M-02B</li>  <li>LTE Category M1/NB1</li>  <li>Multiregion</li>  <li>Data rate M1: up to 375 kb/s UL, 300 kb/s DL</li>  <li>Data rate NB1: up to 62.5 kb/s UL, 27.2 kb/s DL</li>  <li>LiPo charger circuit with 250 mA charging current</li>  <li>Standard LiPo battery connector</li>  <li>USB-C connector</li>  <li>Bi2C</li></ul><h2 id=\"purchase\">Purchase</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://ilabs.se/product/challenger-rp2040-lte/\">Ilabs</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.tindie.com/products/invector/challenger-rp2040-lte/\">Tindie</a></li></ul>"

This board is equipped with an micro SD card reader and a Real Time Clock making it super useful for data logging applications.</p><p>RP2040 is the debut micro controller from Raspberry Pi. It brings their signature values of high performance, low cost, and ease of use to the micro controller space. With a large on-chip memory, symmetric dual-core processor complex, deterministic bus fabric, and rich peripheral set augmented with our unique Programmable I/O (PIO) subsystem, RP2040 provides professional users with unrivaled power and flexibility. With detailed documentation, a polished Circuitpython port, and a UF2 boot loader in ROM, it has the lowest possible barrier to entry for beginner and hobbyist users</p><p>This board is equipped with a micro SD card connector that will house standard micro SD cards allowing your application to have many gigabytes of storage room for sensor data or what ever you want to place on it. Together with a fancy display you could also store cool images.</p><p>It is normally very useful to tag sensor data with a time stamp so we included a Real Time Clock chip to make this easy for you.</p><p>The chip we use is the MCP79410 general purpose I2C™Compatible real-time clock/calendar. It is a highly integrated real time clock with nonvolatile memory and many other advanced features. These features include a battery switchover circuit for backup power, a timestamp to log power failures and digital trimming for accuracy. Using a low-cost 32.768 kHz crystal or other clock source, time is tracked in either a 12-hour or 24-hour format with an AM/PM indicator and timing to the second, minute, hour, day of the week, day, month and year. As an interrupt or wakeup signal, a multifunction open drain output can be programmed as an Alarm Out or as a Clock Out that supports 4 selectable frequencies.</p><p>The intperrupt output from the RTC is connected to pin GPIO25 on the RP2040 and can be used to wake up the device repeatedly to collect data.</p><p>In the recent years we have noticed that we are seeing more and more USB Type C cable laying around the lab due to the fact that all new phones and accessories use them. As of yet we haven’t seen any shortage of micro USB cables but we are not getting any new ones any more and old ones do break occasionally. So we decided to go for a USB Type C connector for this board. A bonus of this is that they are quite bit more durable and you don’t have to fiddle with the cable when plugging it in.</p><p>The board is equipped with a standard 2.0mm JST connector for connecting a rechargeable LiPo battery. There is also an internal battery charger circuit that charges your battery as long as a USB cable is inserted or the VUSB connection is connected to 5V.</p><h2 id=\"purchase\">Purchase</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://ilabs.se/product/challenger-rp2040-sd-rtc/\">Invector Labs)</a></li></ul>"

With a high resolution of 400*300, it provides a delicate display effect and adopts a classic black and white dual-color display to adapt to various application scenarios. It is also equipped with multiple interface and button designs, including TF card slot, BAT interface, UART0 interface, 2x10 pin GPIO interface, back button, home button and rotary switch switch, which is convenient for users to develop and operate. The white acrylic shell is not only beautiful but also protects the screen.</p><p>Based on the ESP32 chip, another highlight is its wide compatibility. It is compatible with three development environments: Arduino IDE, ESP IDF, and MicroPython, simplifying the secondary development process. Also, its ultra-wide viewing angle design allows you to enjoy the same brilliant image from any angle. The ultra-low power consumption feature consumes only a small amount of power when refreshing, ensuring long-lasting battery life. Pure reflection mode means no backlight is required, and information remains clearly visible after power failure, without worrying about information loss.</p><p>Due to its excellent characteristics such as low power consumption, high contrast and high reflectivity, this e-ink screen is widely used in shelf labels, price tags, badges, smart labels, smart home devices, e-readers, smart wearable devices and other portable devices, and is an ideal choice for various smart devices and applications.</p><h2 id=\"technical-details\">Technical Details</h2><ul>  <li>4.2-inch E-Paper display, 400*300 resolution, black and white, using SPI interface communication;</li>  <li>ESP32-S3 as the main chip, frequency up to 240MHz;</li>  <li>Pure reflection mode, no backlight required, completely relying on light reflection to display content, and the displayed content will not be lost even if the power is off;</li>  <li>Hard-coated anti-glare display surface, which can keep the content visible even under direct sunlight;</li>  <li>High contrast and high reflectivity provide a clearer and more vivid visual experience;</li>  <li>Ultra-low power consumption and partial refresh function, significantly saving energy and extending battery life;</li>  <li>Support full viewing angle, clearly visible from any angle;</li>  <li>Rich buttons and interfaces (such as GPIO interface, UART interface, home button, etc.) for easy development and operation；</li>  <li>Equip with Arduino IDE, ESP IDF, and MicroPython development environment for a smooth development experience</li></ul><h2 id=\"specifications\">Specifications</h2><ul>  <li>MCU: ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N8R8</li>  <li>Power Supply: lithium battery, USB Type-C</li>  <li>Supply Voltage: 3~5v</li>  <li>Operating Temperature: 0~50℃</li>  <li>Storage Temperature: -25~70℃</li>  <li>Display Resolution: 300(H)x400(V) Pixel</li>  <li>Connection Method: Wi-Fi, BLE</li>  <li>Screen Size: 4.2 Inch</li>  <li>Active Area: 84.8x63.6</li>  <li>Pixel Pitch: 0.212x0.212</li></ul><h2 id=\"purchase\">Purchase</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.elecrow.com/crowpanel-esp32-4-2-e-paper-hmi-display-with-400-300-resolution-black-white-color-driven-by-spi-interface.html\">Elecrow</a></li></ul>"

        "description": "<p><strong>Crickit</strong> is Adafruit’s <strong>C</strong>reative <strong>R</strong>obotics &amp; <strong>I</strong>nteractive <strong>C</strong>onstruction <strong>Kit</strong>. It’s an add-on to popular Feather ecosystem boards that lets you <strong>#MakeRobotFriend </strong>using CircuitPython.</p><p>Plug in <em>any</em> Feather mainboard you want into the center, and you’re good to go! The Crickit is powered by seesaw, an I2C-to-whatever bridge firmware. So you only need to use two I2C data pins to control the huge number of inputs and outputs on the Crickit. All those timers, PWMs, sensors are offloaded to the co-processor.</p><p>The only thing that is <em>not</em> managed by seesaw is the audio output. Provided is a small jumper you can solder to connect the audio amplifier to the first analog pin. On Feather M0’s this is a true analog output (DAC) and you can play audio clips with CircuitPython. Other Feathers <em>may not have a DAC!</em> In that case, you can solder a wire to jumper the audio amp to a PWM pin.</p><p>You get to use all the non-I2C signal pins on your feather and get a boat-load of extra in/out pins, motor controllers, capacitive touch sensors, a NeoPixel driver and amplified speaker output. It complements &amp; extends your Feather so you can still use all the goodies, including stacking FeatherWings on top. But now you have a robotics playground as well.</p><h2 id=\"technical-details\">Technical details</h2><ul>  <li>4 x Analog or Digital Servo control, with precision 16-bit timers</li>  <li>2 x Bi-directional brushed DC motor control, 1 A current limited each, with 8-bit PWM speed control (or one stepper)</li>  <li>4 x High current “Darlington” 500 mA drive outputs with kick-back diode protection. For solenoids, relays, large LEDs, or one uni-polar stepper</li>  <li>4 x Capacitive touch sensors with alligator-pads</li>  <li>8 x Signal pins, digital in/out or analog inputs</li>  <li>1 x NeoPixel driver with 5V level shifter - The NeoPixels are buffered and controlled by the seesaw chip</li>  <li>1 x Class D, 4-8 ohm speaker, 3 W-max audio amplifier - the audio input pin is available as a solder-able pad for your configuration, you can connect it to your Feather’s DAC or PWM output as you desire.</li></ul><p>All are powered via 5V DC, so you can use any 5V-powered servos, DC motors, steppers, solenoids, relays etc. To keep things simple and safe, we don’t support mixing voltages, so only 5V, not for use with 9V or 12V robotic components.</p><h2 id=\"tutorial\">Tutorial</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-crickit-creative-robotic-interactive-construction-kit\">Feather M0 Express + Crickit Overview</a></li></ul><h2 id=\"purchase\">Purchase</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/3403\">Feather M0 Express - Adafruit</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/3343\">CRICKIT for Feather - Adafruit</a></li></ul>"

With native USB it’s part of the CircuitPython party.</p><p>This chip has twice the flash, and four times the SRAM of its earlier sibling, the nRF52832 - 1 MB of FLASH and 256KB of SRAM. Compared to the nRF51, this board has 4-8 times more of everything.</p><p><strong>This is Adafruit’s first BLE-friendly CircuitPython board</strong>! CircuitPython works best with disk drive access, and this is the only BLE-plus-USB-native chip that has the memory to handle running the Python interpreter. The massive RAM and speedy Cortex M4F chip makes this a good match.</p><p>It’s got tons of peripherals: plenty of GPIO, analog inputs, PWM, timers, etc. Best of all, it’s got that native USB! Finally, no need for a separate USB serial chip like CP2104 or FT232.</p><p>Some other upgrades are an extra ‘USER’ switch that could be used to trigger OTA updates (or whatever you choose), a NeoPixel LED for status updates, 2 MB of QSPI Flash for storing CircuitPython files, and a SWD connector.</p><p>Comes pre-programed the chip with a UF2 bootloader, which can use either command line UART programming with nrfutil or drag-n-drop mass storage, for CircuitPython installation and also because mass-storage-drive bootloaders make updating firmware so easy. Want to program the chip directly? You can use command line tools with your favorite editor and toolchain. If you want to use an SWD programmer/debugger (for even more advanced usage), use a standard 2x5 0.05” connector.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul>  <li>ARM Cortex M4F (with HW floating point acceleration) running at 64MHz</li>  <li>1MB flash and 256KB SRAM</li>  <li><strong>Native Open Source USB stack</strong> - pre-programmed with UF2 bootloader</li>  <li>Bluetooth Low Energy compatible 2.4GHz radio (Details available in the <a href=\"https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Low-power-short-range-wireless/nRF52840\">nRF52840</a> product specification)</li>  <li><strong>FCC / IC / TELEC certified module</strong></li>  <li>Up to +8dBm output power</li>  <li>1.7v to 3.3v operation with internal linear and DC/DC voltage regulators</li>  <li>21 GPIO, 6 x 12-bit ADC pins, up to 12 PWM outputs (3 PWM modules with 4 outputs each)</li>  <li>Pin #3 red LED for general purpose blinking, NeoPixel for colorful feedback</li>  <li>Power/enable pin</li>  <li>Measures 2.0” x 0.9” x 0.28” (51mm x 23mm x 7.2mm) without headers soldered in</li>  <li>Light as a (large?) feather - 6 grams</li>  <li>4 mounting holes</li>  <li>Reset button</li>  <li>SWD connector for debugging</li></ul><h2 id=\"tutorial\">Tutorial</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-the-adafruit-nrf52840-feather\">Feather nRF52840 Express Overview</a></li></ul><h2 id=\"purchase\">Purchase</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/4062\">Adafruit</a></li></ul>"

DisplayIO is also not yet supported.Arduino is supported through STM32duino. There’s no auto-reset bootloader support yet so you have to pull the BOOT0 pin high and manually reset before uploading. That said, STM32 support is really good, and we were able to run just about every sketch we tried.MicroPython support is very solid but Adafruit does not provide MicroPython libraries for sensors!We tested this in Arduino STM32duino with all our FeatherWings and only the RFM69/RFM9x libraries did not work (they are very platform specific).

        "description": "<p>Only 13mm long, <strong>Fomu</strong> really puts the <em>micro</em> in microprocessor. Fomu is a fully open-source, programmable FPGA device that sits inside a USB Type-A port. It has four buttons, an RGB LED, and an FPGA that is compatible with a fully open source chain and capable of running a RISC-V core. Fomu comes in a custom plastic enclosure that slots perfectly into a USB port.</p><p>Fomu:</p><ul>  <li><strong>has Python</strong>    <ul>      <li>With 128 kilobytes of RAM and a large amount of storage, Fomu is powerful enough to run Python natively. And since it lives in your USB port, installation is super simple. FPGAs are complicated, but the latest Python tools make it easy to use Fomu without any specialized training.</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li><strong>runs RISC-V</strong>    <ul>      <li>Underneath the Python interpreter lies a RISC-V softcore running on the FPGA fabric. RISC-V is an up-and-coming processor architecture that is poised to take over everything from deeply-embedded chips to high-performance computing. Fomu’s RISC-V softcore is a great introduction to the processor architecture of the future.</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li><strong>is an FPGA</strong>    <ul>      <li>An FPGA is a piece of reconfigurable silicon. The default Fomu firmware exposes a USB bootloader running a RISC-V softcore, but you can load whatever you want. Softcores are also available for LM32 and OpenRISC. You can practice adding instructions to the CPU, or add new blocks such as LED blink patterns or better captouch hardware blocks.</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li><strong>is entirely open</strong>    <ul>      <li>Developing with Fomu is incredibly easy: just load code via USB and go. Whether you’re writing RISC-V code, Python code, or HDL, it’s all uploaded to Fomu in the same way. The ICE40UP5K FPGA is supported with a fully open toolchain, meaning you can start development without creating an account, signing an NDA, or downloading a multi-gigabyte installer.An FPGA is an Array of Gates that is Field-Programmable. When you buy a chip such as a CPU, the logic cells are all fixed in place. A CPU can run any amount of code, but if you want to do anything exotic you need to create software and, depending on what you want to do, that software can be very slow.</li>    </ul>  </li></ul><p>For example, many embedded projects use WS2812 LEDs such as <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/?q=WS2812\">NeoPixels</a> that require a specialized timing signal. A CPU can generate this signal in software, but it can’t do anything in the background while talking to the light. If the string of LEDs is very long, then the CPU wastes a lot of time and power generating the signal.</p><p>With an FPGA, it becomes possible to create an “LED driver” that allows the CPU to keep running while a hardware component handles the timing. The CPU could do other work, or could put itself in a low power state.</p><p>In fact, the “CPU” in the FPGA is created from a hardware description language, meaning it can be modified or swapped out. If you wanted, you could create a brand-new CPU instruction. Do you want to have fast 64-bit multiplies? Or maybe you want a way to get random numbers easily? With Fomu and its FPGA, you have the source code to the CPU itself.</p><h2 id=\"purchase\">Purchase</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/4332\">Adafruit</a></li></ul>"

The front half has the same shape and pinout as an Adafruit Metro, so it is compatible with many shields. It’s got analog pins where you expect, and SPI/UART/I2C hardware support in the same spot as the Metro 328 and M0. But! It’s powered with an ATSAMD51P20:</p><ul>  <li>Cortex M4 core running at <strong>120 MHz</strong></li>  <li><a href=\"https://developer.arm.com/technologies/dsp/dsp-for-cortex-m\">Floating point support with Cortex M4 DSP instructions</a></li>  <li><strong>1MB</strong> flash, <strong>256 KB</strong> RAM</li>  <li>32-bit, 3.3V logic and power</li>  <li><strong>70 GPIO pins in total</strong></li>  <li>Dual 1 MSPS DAC (A0 and A1)</li>  <li>Dual 1 MSPS ADC (15 analog pins)</li>  <li>8 x hardware SERCOM (can be I2C, SPI or UART)</li>  <li>22 x PWM outputs</li>  <li>Stereo I2S input/output with MCK pin</li>  <li>12-bit Parallel capture controller (for camera/video in)</li>  <li>Built in crypto engines with AES (256 bit), true RNG, Pubkey controller</li></ul><p>Extras:</p><ul>  <li><strong>Power the Grand Central</strong> with 6-12V polarity protected DC or the micro USB connector to any 5V USB source. The 2.1mm DC jack has an on/off switch next to it so you can turn off your setup easily. The board will automagically switch between USB and DC.</li>  <li><strong>Grand Central has 62 GPIO pins</strong>, 16 of which are analog in, and two of which is a true analog out. There’s a hardware SPI port, hardware I2C port and hardware UART. 5 more SERCOMs are available for extra I2C/SPI/UARTs.</li>  <li><strong>Logic level is 3.3V</strong></li>  <li><strong>Native USB</strong>, there’s no need for a hardware USB to Serial converter as the Metro M4 has built in USB support. When used to act like a serial device, the USB interface can be used by any computer to listen/send data to the METRO, and can also be used to launch and update code via the bootloader. It can also act like an HID keyboard or mouse.</li>  <li><strong>Four indicator LEDs and one NeoPixel</strong>, on the front edge of the PCB, for easy debugging. One green power LED, two RX/TX LEDs for data being sent over USB, and a red LED connected. Next to the reset button there is an RGB NeoPixel that can be used for any purpose.</li>  <li><strong>8 MB QSPI Flash </strong>storage chip is included on board. You can use the SPI Flash storage like a very tiny hard drive. When used in Circuit Python, the 8 MB flash acts as storage for all your scripts, libraries and files.</li>  <li><strong>Micro SD Card slot</strong> - removable storage of any size, connected to an SPI SERCOM (SDIO is not supported)</li>  <li><strong>Easy reprogramming</strong>, comes pre-loaded with the <a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-metro-m0-express-designed-for-circuitpython/uf2-bootloader\">UF2 bootloader</a>, which looks like a USB storage key. Simply drag firmware on to program, no special tools or drivers needed! It can be used to load up CircuitPython (it is bossa v1.8 compatible)</li></ul><p>The primary target for this board is CircuitPython - with 120 MHz, and 256KB of RAM CircuitPython runs <em>really</em> well on this chip!</p><h2 id=\"tutorial\">Tutorial</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-grand-central\">Grand Central M4 Express Overview</a></li></ul><h2 id=\"purchase\">Purchase</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/4064\">Adafruit</a></li></ul>"

But what if we made it even easier than that? <strong>Like, no solder, no wiring, just instant plug-and-play?</strong> Dream no more - with the <strong>Adafruit Matrix Portal add-on for RGB Matrices</strong>, there’s never been an easier way to create powerful Internet-connected LED displays.</p><p>Plug directly into the back of <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/category/327\">any HUB-75 compatible display (all the ones we stock will work) from 16x32 up to 64x64</a>! Use the included screws to attach the power cable to the power plugs with a common screwdriver, then power it with any USB C power supply. (For larger projects, power the matrices with a separate 5V power adapter)</p><p>Then code up your project in <a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/rgb-led-matrices-matrix-panels-with-circuitpython\">CircuitPython</a> or <a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-protomatter-rgb-matrix-library\">Arduino</a>, our Protomatter matrix library works great on the SAMD51 chipset, knowing that you’ve got the wiring and level shifting all handled.</p><h3 id=\"features\">Features</h3><ul>  <li><strong>ATSAMD51J19 Cortex M4 processor</strong>, 512 KB flash, 192 K of SRAM, with full Arduino or CircuitPython support</li>  <li><strong>ESP32 WiFi co-processor</strong> with TLS support and SPI interface to the M4, with full Arduino or CircuitPython support</li>  <li><strong>USB-C</strong> connector for data and power connectivity</li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/category/620\"><strong>I2C STEMMA QT connector</strong> for plug-n-play use of any of our STEMMA QT devices or sensors</a> can also be used with <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/4528\">any Grove I2C devices using this adapter cable</a>)</li>  <li><strong>JST 3-pin connector</strong> that also has analog input/output, say for adding audio playback to projects</li>  <li><strong>LIS3DH accelerometer</strong> for digital sand projects or detecting taps/orientation.</li>  <li><strong>GPIO breakouts</strong> including 4 analog outputs with PWM and SPI support for adding other hardware.</li>  <li><strong>Address E line jumper</strong> for use with 64x64 matrices (check your matrix to see which pin is used for address E!</li>  <li><strong>Two user interface buttons</strong> + one reset button</li>  <li><strong>Indicator NeoPixel</strong> and red LED</li>  <li><strong>Green power indicator LEDs</strong> for both 3 V and 5 V power</li>  <li><strong>2x10 socket connector</strong> fits snugly into 2x8 HUB75 ports without worrying about ‘off by one’ errors.</li></ul><p>The Matrix Portal uses an ATMEL (Microchip) ATSAMD51J19, and an Espressif ESP32 Wi-Fi coprocessor with TLS/SSL support built-in. The M4 and ESP32 are a great couple - and each bring their own strengths to this board. The SAMD51 M4 has native USB so it can show up like a disk drive, act as a MIDI or HID keyboard/mouse, and of course bootload and debug over a serial port. It also has DACs, ADC, PWM, and tons of GPIO, so it can handle the high speed updating of the RGB matrix.</p><p>Meanwhile, the ESP32 has secure WiFi capabilities, and plenty of Flash and RAM to buffer sockets. By letting the ESP32 focus on the complex TLS/SSL computation and socket buffering, it frees up the SAMD51 to act as the user interface. You get a great programming experience thanks to the native USB with files available for drag-n-drop, and you don’t have to spend a ton of processor time and memory to do SSL encryption/decryption and certificate management. It’s the best of both worlds!</p><p>Comes with one fully-programmed and assembled MatrixPortal, preprogrammed with a rainbow digital sand demo for 32x64 LED matrices.</p><h2 id=\"purchase\">Purchase:</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/4745\">Adafruit</a></li></ul>"

Around the edges are 0.050″ spaced breakouts for the six analog pins, including true analog out, and several digital pins available on the SAMD51G including some dedicated I2C, SPI, and UART connections.</p><p>The Mini SAM boards include two LED indicators; a standard “Built-In” LED and an APA102 RGB LED.  The standard LED is red and located on the reverse side of the board.  When illuminated it lights up the spaceship on on the logo. There are two built-in buttons as well; a RESET button and a user programmable BUTTON.</p><h2 id=\"memory\">Memory</h2><p>In order to support CircuitPython, a 2MB Quad-SPI flash memory chip is included. This provides plenty of space for the CircuitPython program as well as space for user programming.  It comes pre-loaded with the latest CircuitPython library bundle.</p><h2 id=\"power\">Power</h2><p>The boards include a 600mA 3.3V regulator, more than enough to power this little board and its built-in features. The board can be powered from a micro-USB or via a battery connected to the BAT pin – it will automatically switch between the two.  There are exposed pads to solder on an optional 2-JST battery connector on the back or directly to the BAT pin.</p><h2 id=\"purchase\">Purchase</h2><p>When in stock, you can purchase a board from minifigboards.com</p><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://minifigboards.com/products/mini-sam-m4\">Minifigboards.com</a></li></ul>"

You’ll getthe same quality display as our Raspberry Pi Eyes kit but without needing to totearound a full Linux computer</p><p>This unique design has the eyes at the same pupil-distance as a human (~63mm) but isdesigned so that the nose section can be broken apart with pliers/cutters and thenwired together with a 9-pin JST SH cable up to 100mm long so the eyes can bere-positioned or freely attached.</p><p>We wanted to make audio-effects easier so in addition to a class D audio amp, there’salso a stereo headphone jack that is connected to the two DACs on the chip. Use itwhen you want an externally sound amplifier box for big effects. For small portableeffects, the built-in amp can drive 8 ohm speakers up to 1 Watt.</p><p>On each side are JST-PH plugs for connecting external devices. The 3-pin JSTs connectto analog/timer pins on the SAMD51, so you can use them for sensors or GPIOdevices. The 4-pin JST connector connects to the I2C port and you can fit Groveconnectors in it for additional hardware support. For the PDM mic port, you can usethis cable to wire to a PDM mic.</p><p>There’s also plenty of sensors built in - light sensor, 3 tactile buttons, and acapacitive touch pad on the nose.</p><p>Speaking of that nose, the silkscreen is by the skillful Miss Monster, check out those fangs!</p><p>This is by far the cutest, creepiest and most incredible development board we’ve made so far!Gaze upon these features:</p><ul>  <li>ATSAMD51G19 Cortex M4 microcontroller running at 120MHz with 512KB Flash, 192KB RAM</li>  <li>8 MB QSPI flash for storing graphics and sound effects</li>  <li>Two 240x240 IPS TFT displays each on their own SPI bus</li>  <li>Beautiful silkscreen with a boop-able nose that is a capacitive touch pad</li>  <li>Lipoly battery charge circuit for portable use</li>  <li>Stereo headphone jack out, for sound effects via an amplifier</li>  <li>Mono speaker driver for smaller 8 ohm 1W speakers</li>  <li>One 4 pin STEMMA JST connector for I2C connection (also Grove compatible)</li>  <li>Two 3 pin STEMMA JST connectors with digital/analog/PWM for servos, sensors, etc</li>  <li>One 4 pin JST SH port for connecting an optional PDM microphone</li>  <li>Backlight controls</li>  <li>Three tactile buttons</li>  <li>Light sensor</li>  <li>On/Off Switch and reset button</li></ul><h2 id=\"tutorial\">Tutorial</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-monster-m4sk-eyes\">MONSTER M4SK Overview</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/products/4343/guides\">Projects and Guides</a></li></ul><h2 id=\"purchase\">Purchase</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/4343\">Adafruit</a></li></ul>"

Plug in your phone, a drum machine, a laptop, guitar pedals or a microphone.</li>  <li>A computer that uses tiny program cards that are completely hackable. Anyone who writes code can make, share, sell their creations — sequencers, effects, interfaces.</li></ul><p>The Workshop System arrives as a DIY kit which will take a few hours to put together. All the tiny SMD components have already been soldered for you, so the build process consists mainly of soldering jack sockets, potentiometers and switches while following the build guide: <a href=\"https://musicthing.co.uk/Workshop_System_Build_Guide\">musicthing.co.uk/Workshop_System_Build_Guide</a></p><p>The Workshop System kit includes:</p><ul>  <li>All hardware required to build the Workshop System (PCBs, Front &amp; Back Panel, components, knobs, buttons etc.)</li>  <li>A rugged hard plastic carry case for easy portability with internal foam cutout to keep the system protected</li>  <li>2 x audio adaptor cables to plug a guitar pedal into the Stompbox section of the Workshop System –  the cables are 3.5mm (1/8″) Minijack to 6.35mm (1/4″) Jack</li>  <li>A 20cm DC barrel cable for directly powering a guitar pedal from the front of the Workshop – 9V (centre-negative)</li>  <li>A keyring and set of 4 x Program Cards to get started using the computer section. The included cards are: a <strong>Turing Machine</strong> (random looping sequencer), a lush digital <strong>Reverb</strong>, a <strong>MIDI to CV</strong> converter and a <strong>Blank</strong> card to fill with another function of your choice  – or to explore creating programmes of your own. More blank cards can be found <a href=\"https://www.thonk.co.uk/shop/mtm-workshop-blank-card-set/\">HERE</a></li></ul><p>The kit does not include:</p><ul>  <li>Eurorack patch cables – we figure that many users of modular synths already have patch cables lying around – but if you’re just starting out and would like a set of short patch cables then we have a cable set available <a href=\"https://www.thonk.co.uk/shop/mtm-eurorack-patch-cables/\">HERE</a></li>  <li>A power cable – The Workshop System has two power options: The easiest way is via USB-C PD power, but you can also use a regular 15-25v DC barrel connection. The system will happily run from battery powerbanks and laptop adaptors. We feel that there are already enough USB-C cables in the world. If you do want to source a USB-C wallwart then we recommend using one that’s rated at 30W or above.</li></ul><p>The Workshop System has 14 modules:</p><ul>  <li>2 x SineSquare Oscillators Simple vintage-style oscillators made of 1970s tech.</li>  <li>2 x Humpback Filters Similarly vintage-style filters, designed by Philip Goulding of God’s Box.</li>  <li>2 x Slopes These work as attack/decay envelopes, LFOs and portamento generators.</li>  <li>Computer Is a multi-function module with knobs, a switch and audio, CV and pulse ins and outs. Initially, the system comes with a USB MIDI card, a Turing Machine sequencer and a Reverb card. A community of programmers are creating more cards.</li>  <li>Stereo In takes a 3.5mm stereo input and boosts it to modular level.</li>  <li>Ring Mod is a great-sounding ring modulator, connected to the two sines. It also works as a simple VCA.</li>  <li>Stompbox is an interface for guitar pedals, with blend and feedback controls to make boring pedals more interesting. There’s a 9v power outlet for pedals below this module.</li>  <li>Amplifier contains two simple circuits. One is connected to a piezo contact mic behind the panel, the other is the transistor-based input circuit from a MiniMoog. In other words, a Mikrophonie and a Mini Drive.</li>  <li>4 Voltages is a minimum viable keyboard: four voltage outputs, one knob, four pushbuttons. More fun to play with than to explain.</li>  <li>Mix a simple output mixer, with two stereo channels, two mono channels and a powerful headphone amp / line out.</li>  <li>PSU behind the panel is a power supply that runs on USB-C PD power or professional 15-25v barrel connectors. It works from battery powerbanks and laptop adaptors, most likely something you’ve already got at home.</li></ul><h2 id=\"purchase\">Purchase</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.thonk.co.uk/workshopsystem/\">Thonk.co.uk</a></li></ul>"

So we thought, hey what if we made something like that but with fully programmable color NeoPixels? And this is what we came up with!</p><p>The PCB is designed to slip into any USB A port on a computer or laptop. There’s an ATSAMD21 microcontroller on board with just enough circuitry to keep it happy. One pin of the microcontroller connects to the four NeoPixel LEDs. Two other pins are used as capacitive touch inputs on the end - if you look carefully you can see the slotted end has left and right touch pads. A reset button lets you enter bootloader mode if necessary. That’s it!</p><p>The SAMD21 can run CircuitPython or Arduino very nicely - with existing NeoPixel and our FreeTouch libraries for the capacitive touch input. Over the USB connection you can have serial, MIDI or HID connectivity. The Neo Trinkey is perfect for simple projects that can use a few user inputs and colorful outputs. Maybe you’ll set it up as a simple status notifier, or stretch-break timer, or a macro keypad, or a random color generator, or, hey you could still make it into an LED flashlight if you wanted!</p><p>We think its just an adorable little board, small and durable and inexpensive enough that it could be a first microcontroller board, or inspiration for advanced developers to make something simple and fun.</p><ul>  <li>ATSAMD21E18 32-bit Cortex M0+ - 48 MHz 32 bit processor with 256KB Flash and 32 KB RAM</li>  <li>Native USB supported by every OS - can be used in Arduino or CircuitPython as USB serial console, MIDI, Keyboard/Mouse HID, even a little disk drive for storing Python scripts.</li>  <li>Can be used with Arduino IDE or CircuitPython</li>  <li>Four RGB NeoPixel LEDs</li>  <li>Two Capacitive Touch pads</li>  <li>Reset switch for starting your project code over or entering bootloader mode</li>  <li>Slim and cute, keychain-friendly!</li></ul><h2 id=\"purchase\">Purchase</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/4870\">Adafruit</a></li></ul>"

Introducing the Tiny 2350 - a teeny tiny powerhouse with the chops to realise truly ambitious projects.</p><p>Programmable via USB-C, Tiny 2350 comes with <strong>4MB of flash storage</strong> on board. The board is designed with castellated pads to allow it to be directly soldered onto a PCB (or you can attach <a href=\"https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-header-pack\">pin headers</a> to hook it up on a breadboard or connect things to it directly with wires). We’ve also managed to fit in a <strong>programmable RGB LED</strong>, a <strong>reset button</strong>, a <strong>Qw/ST connector</strong> for connecting up I2C devices and some clever circuitry that lets you use the boot button as a user controllable switch.</p><p>It’s compatible with firmware built for the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 but offers a reduced number of pins due to its size. You can even run MicroPython on it!</p><h2 id=\"features\">Features</h2><ul>  <li>Powered by RP2350A (Dual Arm Cortex M33 running at up to 150MHz with 520KB of SRAM)</li>  <li>4MB of QSPI flash supporting XiP</li>  <li>USB-C connector for power, programming, and data transfer</li>  <li>User controllable RGB LED</li>  <li>Qw/ST (Qwiic/STEMMA QT) connector for attaching breakouts</li>  <li>Twelve IO pins (including four 12-bit ADC channels)</li>  <li>Reset and BOOT buttons (the BOOT button can also be used as a user button)</li>  <li>On-board 3V3 regulator (max regulator current output 300mA)</li>  <li>Input voltage range 3V - 5.5V</li>  <li>Programmable with C/C++ or MicroPython</li>  <li>Dimensions: approx 22.9 x 18 x 5.8mm (L x W x H, including the USB-C port)</li></ul><h2 id=\"about-rp2350\">About RP2350</h2><p>The RP2350 chip is the Double Quarter Pounder &amp; Fries to the RP2040’s Double Cheeseburger and can have one or more RISC-V burgers instead of either of the M33 ARMs, to stretch the metaphor.</p><p>In addition to the modern M33 ARM cores, there are sides of: more PIO capability, a variety of low power states for sipping electrons, a whole security system and some sprinklings of specialist digital video circuits to offload DVI/HDMI output.</p><p>You can expect a tasty boost in performance - our “real world” MicroPython tests are running up to 2x faster compared to RP2040, and floating point number crunching in C/C++ is up to 20x faster. The extra on-chip RAM will make a big difference when performing memory intensive operations (such as working with higher resolution displays) and even more can be added thanks to external PSRAM support.</p><p>RP2350 comes in two flavours - A (standard) and B (all the pins). The B chip has a stonking 48 usable GPIO pins, including 8 ADCs and 24 PWMs, and features on some of our new products.</p><h2 id=\"purchase\">Purchase</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/tiny-2350\">Pimoroni</a></li></ul>"

There is an additional 2 MB of QSPI flash for file storage, handy for images, fonts, sounds, or game assets.</p><p>On the front, there is a 1.8” 160x128 color TFT display with dimmable backlight. There is fast DMA support for drawing, so updates are incredibly fast. There are also 8 silicone-top buttons: they are clicky but have a soft button top so they’re nice and grippy. The buttons are arranged to mimic a gaming handheld, with a d-pad, 2 menu-select buttons and 2 fire-action buttons. There are also 5 NeoPixel LEDs to dazzle or track activity.</p><p>On the back, there is a full Feather-compatible header socket set, so you can plug in any FeatherWing to expand the capabilities of the PyBadge. There are also 3 STEMMA connectors - two 3-pin with ADC/PWM capability and one 4-pin that connects to I2C - you can use this for Grove sensors as well.</p><p>For built-in sensors, there is a light sensor that points out the front, and a 3-axis accelerometer that can detect taps and free-fall. To make bleeps and bloops, there’s a built in buzzer-speaker. For projects where you need more volume, you can plug in an 8 ohm speaker.</p><p>You can power the PyBadge from any of Adafruit’s LiPoly batteries, but <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/category/574\">this 400mAh one</a> is suggested.

It connects to your PC over USB, giving you a USB flash drive to save your Python scripts, and a serial Python prompt (a REPL) for instant programming. Requires a micro USB cable, and will work with Windows, Mac and Linux.</p><p>There are 3 main ways to control the pyboard:</p><ul>  <li><strong>REPL:</strong> Connecting to your PC via USB, the board appears as a USB virtual comms port (CDC VCP) and you can use any serial program to connect and get a Python REPL prompt. This allows you to instantly type and execute Python commands, just like you would when running Python on your PC. You can also redirect the REPL to any of the UARTs on the pyboard.</li>  <li><strong>Remote script:</strong> You can change from REPL to raw REPL mode by sending ctrl-A, and then in raw REPL mode you can send an arbitrary Python script to the board for it to execute immediately. A Python script is available which makes using this mode very simple: you just run python pyboard.py script_to_run.py and this will execute script_to_run.py on the pyboard, returning any output.</li>  <li><strong>From file:</strong> The pyboard has a small, built-in filesystem which lives in part of the flash memory of the microcontroller. It also has an SD card slot if you want to extend the available storage. When you connect the pyboard to your PC, it appears as a USB flash storage device and you can access (mount) the internal filesystem and the SD card this way. If you copy a Python script to the filesystem and call it main.py then the board will execute this script when it starts up. This way you can run scripts without being connected to a PC.</li></ul><p><strong>Main features of the hardware:</strong></p><ul>  <li>STM32F405RG microcontroller</li>  <li>168 MHz Cortex M4 CPU with hardware floating point</li>  <li>1024KiB flash ROM and 192KiB RAM</li>  <li>Micro USB connector for power and serial communication</li>  <li>Micro SD card slot, supporting standard and high capacity SD cards</li>  <li>3-axis accelerometer (MMA7660)</li>  <li>Real time clock with optional battery backup</li>  <li>24 GPIO on left and right edges and 5 GPIO on bottom row, plus LED and switch GPIO available on bottom row</li>  <li>3x 12-bit analog to digital converters, available on 16 pins, 4 with analog ground shielding</li>  <li>2x 12-bit digital to analog (DAC) converters, available on pins X5 and X6</li>  <li>4 LEDs (red, green, yellow and blue)</li>  <li>1 reset and 1 user switch</li>  <li>On-board 3.3V LDO voltage regulator, capable of supplying up to 300mA, input voltage range 3.6V to 10V</li>  <li>DFU bootloader in ROM for easy upgrading of firmware</li></ul><h2 id=\"purchase\">Purchase</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/2390\">Adafruit</a></li></ul>"

There is an additional 8 MB of QSPI flash for file storage, handy for images, fonts, sounds, or game assets.</p><p>On the front, you get a 1.8” 160x128 color TFT display with a dimmable backlight. There is fast DMA support for drawing - screen updates are incredibly fast. A dual-potentiometer analog stick gives great control, with easy diagonal movement, or really any direction you like.There are also 4 square-top buttons which fit <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/4228\">square top button caps</a> (available separately). The buttons are arranged to mimic a gaming handheld, with 2 menu-select buttons and 2 fire-action buttons. There are also 5 NeoPixel LEDs below the LCD screen to dazzle or track activity.</p><p>On the back, there is a full Feather-compatible header socket set to allow plugging in any FeatherWing, providinge expansion of the PyGamer’s capabilities. There are 3 integrated STEMMA connectors: two 3-pin with ADC/PWM capability and one 4-pin that connects to I2C -  this can be used for Grove sensors as well.</p><p>For built in sensors, there’s a light sensor that points out the front, and a 3-axis accelerometer that can detect taps and free-fall. To make bleeps and bloops, plug in any set of stereo headphones. For projects where you need more volume, you can plug in an 8 ohm speaker. The PyGamer will auto-switch to speakers when they’re plugged in.</p><p>You can power the PyGamer from any Adafruit LiPoly battery, but <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/2750\">this 350mAh one</a> is suggested as it will fit into the <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/4238\">Adafruit PyGamer acrylic case</a> (sold separately). An on-off switch will save battery power when not in use. Or power the PyGamer from the Micro USB port - it will also charge up the battery if one is attached.</p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/yX2SuS0rK2A?t=1167\" title=\"PyGamer\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/yX2SuS0rK2A/0.jpg\" alt=\"PyGamer\" /></a></p><h2 id=\"tutorial\">Tutorial</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-pygamer\">PyGamer Overview</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/products/4242/guides\">Projects and Guides</a></li></ul><h2 id=\"purchase\">Purchase</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/4242\">Adafruit</a></li></ul>"

On the reverse side of the PyRuler, just like with our PCB ruler, you have a reference board right at your fingertips.</p><p>While you can use the PyRuler with the Arduino IDE, it ships with CircuitPython on board. When you plug it in, it will show up as a very small disk drive with code.py on it. Edit code.py with your favorite text editor to build your project using Python, the most popular programming language. No installs, IDE or compiler needed, so you can use it on any computer, even ChromeBooks or computers you can’t install software on. When you’re done, unplug the Trinket M0 and your code will go with you.

        "description": "<p>The Raspberry Pi foundation changed single-board computing when they released the Raspberry Pi computer, now they’re ready to do the same for microcontrollers with the release of the brand new <strong>Raspberry Pi Pico</strong>. This low-cost microcontroller board features a powerful new chip, the <strong>RP2040</strong>, and all the fixin’s to get started with embedded electronics projects at a stress-free price.</p><p>The Pico is 0.825” x 2” and can have headers soldered in for use in a breadboard or perfboard, or can be soldered directly onto a PCB with the castellated pads. There’s 20 pads on each side, with groups of general purpose input-and-output (GPIO) pins interleaved with plenty of ground pins. All of the GPIO pins are 3.3V logic, and are not 5V-safe so stick to 3V! You get a total of 26 GPIO pins, 3 of those can be analog inputs (the chip has 4 ADC but one is not broken out). There are no true analog output (DAC) pins.</p><p>On the slim green board is minimal circuitry to get you going: A 5V to 3.3V power supply converter, single green LED on GP25, boot select button, RP2040 chip with dual-core Cortex M0, 2 MegaBytes of QSPI flash storage, and crystal.</p><p><strong>Inside the RP2040 is a ‘permanent ROM’ USB UF2 bootloader.</strong> What that means is when you want to program new firmware, you can hold down the BOOTSEL button while plugging it into USB (or pulling down the RUN/Reset pin to ground) and it will appear as a USB disk drive you can drag the firmware onto. Folks who have been using Adafruit products will find this very familiar - we use the technique all our native-USB boards. Just note you don’t double-click reset, instead hold down BOOTSEL during boot to enter the bootloader!</p><p>The RP2040 is a powerful chip, which has the clock speed of our M4 (SAMD51), and two cores that are equivalent to our M0 (SAMD21). Since it is an M0 chip, it does not have a floating point unit, or DSP hardware support - so if you’re doing something with heavy floating point math, it will be done in software and thus not as fast as an M4. For many other computational tasks, you’ll get close-to-M4 speeds!</p><p>For peripherals, there are two I2C controllers, two SPI controllers, and two UARTs that are multiplexed across the GPIO - check the pinout for what pins can be set to which. There are 16 PWM channels, each pin has a channel it can be set to (ditto on the pinout).</p><p>You’ll note there’s no I2S peripheral, or SDIO, or camera, what’s up with that? Well instead of having specific hardware support for serial-data-like peripherals like these, the RP2040 comes with the PIO state machine system which is a unique and powerful way to create custom hardware logic and data processing blocks that run on their own without taking up a CPU. For example, NeoPixels - often we bitbang the timing-specific protocol for these LEDs. For the RP2040, we instead use a PIO object that reads in the data buffer and clocks out the right bitstream with perfect accuracy. Same with I2S audio in or out, LED matrix displays, 8-bit or SPI based TFTs, even VGA! In MicroPython and CircuitPython you can create PIO control commands to script the peripheral and load it in at runtime. There are 2 PIO peripherals with 4 state machines each.</p><p><strong>There is <a href=\"https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk\">great C/C++ support</a>, unofficial (but really good) <a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/rp2040-arduino-with-the-earlephilhower-core\">Arduino support</a> an official <a href=\"https://micropython.org/download/?mcu=rp2040\">MicroPython port</a>, and a CircuitPython port!</strong> We of course <a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython\">recommend CircuitPython because we think its the easiest way to get started</a> and it has support with most our drivers, displays, sensors, and more, supported out of the box so you can follow along with our CircuitPython projects and tutorials.</p><p>While the RP2040 has lots of onboard RAM (264KB), it does not have built in FLASH memory. Instead that is provided by the external QSPI flash chip. On this board there is 2MB, which is shared between the program its running and any file storage used by MicroPython or CircuitPython. When using C/C++ you get the whole flash memory, if using Python you will have about 1 MB remaining for code, files, images, fonts, etc.</p><p><strong>RP2040 Chip features:</strong></p><ul>  <li>Dual ARM Cortex-M0+ @ 133MHz</li>  <li>264kB on-chip SRAM in six independent banks</li>  <li>Support for up to 16MB of off-chip Flash memory via dedicated QSPI bus</li>  <li>DMA controller</li>  <li>Fully-connected AHB crossbar</li>  <li>Interpolator and integer divider peripherals</li>  <li>On-chip programmable LDO to generate core voltage</li>  <li>2 on-chip PLLs to generate USB and core clocks</li>  <li>30 GPIO pins, 4 of which can be used as analog inputs</li>  <li>Peripherals</li>  <li>2 UARTs</li>  <li>2 SPI controllers</li>  <li>2 I2C controllers</li>  <li>16 PWM channels</li>  <li>USB 1.1 controller and PHY, with host and device support</li>  <li>8 PIO state machines</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://raspberrypi.org/documentation/pico/getting-started/\">Click here for the Raspberry Pi documentation.</a><a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-raspberry-pi-pico-circuitpython\">Click here for Getting Started with Raspberry Pi Pico and CircuitPython.</a></p><h2 id=\"purchase\">Purchase</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/4883\">Adafruit</a></li></ul>"

There are no true analog output (DAC) pins.</p><p>On the slim green board is minimal circuitry to get you going: A 5V to 3.3V power supply converter, single green LED connected through on the wireless module, boot select button, RP2040 chip with dual-core Cortex M0, Wireless chipset with antenna, 2 MegaBytes of QSPI flash storage, and crystal.</p><p><strong>Inside the RP2040 is a ‘permanent ROM’ USB UF2 bootloader</strong>. What that means is when you want to program new firmware, you can hold down the BOOTSEL button while plugging it into USB (or pulling down the RUN/Reset pin to ground) and it will appear as a USB disk drive you can drag the firmware onto. Folks who have been using Adafruit products will find this very familiar - we use the technique all our native-USB boards. Just note you don’t double-click reset, instead hold down BOOTSEL during boot to enter the bootloader!</p><p>The RP2040 is a powerful chip, which has the clock speed of our M4 (SAMD51), and two cores that are equivalent to our M0 (SAMD21). Since it is an M0 chip, it does not have a floating point unit, or DSP hardware support - so if you’re doing something with heavy floating point math, it will be done in software and thus not as fast as an M4. For many other computational tasks, you’ll get close-to-M4 speeds!</p><p>For peripherals, there are two I2C controllers, two SPI controllers, and two UARTs that are multiplexed across the GPIO - check the pinout for what pins can be set to which. There are 16 PWM channels, each pin has a channel it can be set to (ditto on the pinout).</p><p>You’ll note there’s no I2S peripheral, or SDIO, or camera, what’s up with that? Well instead of having specific hardware support for serial-data-like peripherals like these, the RP2040 comes with the PIO state machine system which is a unique and powerful way to create <em>custom hardware logic and data processing blocks</em> that run on their own without taking up a CPU. For example, NeoPixels - often we bitbang the timing-specific protocol for these LEDs. For the RP2040, we instead use a PIO object that reads in the data buffer and clocks out the right bitstream with perfect accuracy. <a href=\"https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/tree/master/pio\">Same with I2S audio in or out, LED matrix displays, 8-bit or SPI based TFTs, even VGA</a>! In MicroPython and CircuitPython you can create PIO control commands to script the peripheral and load it in at runtime. There are 2 PIO peripherals with 4 state machines each.</p><p><strong>There is great <a href=\"https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk\">C/C++ support</a>, an official <a href=\"https://github.com/raspberrypi/micropython\">MicroPython port</a>, and a <a href=\"https://circuitpython.org/downloads\">CircuitPython port</a>!</strong> We of course <a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython\">recommend CircuitPython because we think it’s the easiest way to get started</a> and it has support with most of our drivers, displays, sensors, and more, supported out of the box so you can follow along with our CircuitPython projects and tutorials.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico\">For Arduino usage we recommend the Philhower Arduino core, which does not use mbed, has lots of peripherals supported, and many makers/companies have submitted board definitions.</a></p><p>While the RP2040 has lots of onboard RAM (264KB), it does not have built-in FLASH memory. Instead, that is provided by the external QSPI flash chip. On this board, there is 2MB, which is shared between the program it’s running and any file storage used by MicroPython or CircuitPython. When using C/C++ you get the whole flash memory, if using Python you will have about 1 MB remaining for code, files, images, fonts, etc.</p><p><strong>RP2040 Chip features:</strong></p><ul>  <li>Dual ARM Cortex-M0+ @ 133MHz</li>  <li>264kB on-chip SRAM in six independent banks</li>  <li>Support for up to 16MB of off-chip Flash memory via dedicated QSPI bus</li>  <li>DMA controller</li>  <li>Fully-connected AHB crossbar</li>  <li>Interpolator and integer divider peripherals</li>  <li>On-chip programmable LDO to generate core voltage</li>  <li>2 on-chip PLLs to generate USB and core clocks</li>  <li>30 GPIO pins, 4 of which can be used as analog inputs</li>  <li>Peripherals    <ul>      <li>2 UARTs</li>      <li>2 SPI controllers</li>      <li>2 I2C controllers</li>      <li>16 PWM channels</li>      <li>USB 1.1 controller and PHY, with host and device support</li>      <li>8 PIO state machines</li>    </ul>  </li></ul><p><a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html#raspberry-pi-pico-w\">Click here for the Raspberry Pi documentation.</a><a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-raspberry-pi-pico-circuitpython\">Click here for Getting Started with Raspberry Pi Pico and CircuitPython.</a></p><h2 id=\"purchase\">Purchase</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/5526\">Adafruit</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://grobotronics.com/raspberry-pi-pico-w-wireless.html\">Grobotronics</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://nettop.gr/index.php/raspberry-pi/pico/raspberry-pi-pico-kits/raspberry-pi-pico-w.html\">Nettop</a></li></ul>"

It is <a href=\"https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/labels/broadcom\">missing features and has known issues</a>.</p><p>The <strong>Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4</strong> is based on the <a href=\"http://www.adafruit.com/product/4297\">Raspberry Pi 4 Model B</a>, but in a smaller form factor - perfect for embedding into products or projects without the bulk of a classic Raspberry Pi. You get all the computational power of Raspberry Pi 4 in a compact form factor for deeply embedded applications. The CM4 incorporates the same quad-core ARM Cortex-A72 processor, dual video output, gigabit Ethernet, UART, I2C, SPI, I2S, and a few PWM for good measure.</p><p>This module is available in <strong>multiple variants</strong>, with a range of RAM and eMMC Flash options, and with or without wireless connectivity. The modules are available with 1GB, 2GB, 4GB or 8GB LPDDR4-3200 SDRAM with optional storage of 8GB, 16GB or 32GB eMMC Flash. The wireless option includes 2.4GHz and 5GHz 802.11b/g/n/ac wireless LAN and Bluetooth 5.0 for BT classic and BTLE support.</p><h5 id=\"this-product-version-of-the-cm4-modules-comes-with-4gb-ram-32gb-mmc-and-wifi\"><strong>This product version of the CM4 modules comes with 4GB RAM 32GB MMC, and WiFi!</strong></h5><p><strong>Note: We don’t include the <a href=\"http://www.adafruit.com/product/4787\">Compute Module IO board</a>, but it’s strongly recommended!</strong></p><p>Compute ALL the THINGs!</p><p><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/4092\">Compared to the earlier Compute Module 3+</a>, the CM4 features faster CPU cores, better multimedia, more interfacing capabilities, a range of RAM densities, and a wireless connectivity option. Instead of a DIMM socket, there are two board-to-board connectors that carry high-speed signals with ease - like multiple MIPI displays and camera ports. In addition to all the pins that supply Ethernet and SDIO and SPI and such, there’s also 28 GPIO pins, with up to 6 × UART, 6 × I2C and 5 × SPI.</p><p>On the video side, there are dual HDMI output, VideoCore VI graphics with OpenGL ES 3.x support, 4Kp60 hardware decode of H.265 (HEVC) video, and 1080p30 hardware encode of H.264 (AVC) video.</p><p>It’s great for industrial control or robotic use, digital/video signage, IoT, and AI/machine learning projects</p><p>Compute Module 4 introduces a brand new form factor and a compatibility break with earlier Compute Modules. Where previous modules adopted the JEDEC DDR2 SODIMM mechanical standard, with I/O signals on an edge connector, we now bring I/O signals to two high-density perpendicular connectors (one for power and low-speed interfaces, and one for high-speed interfaces).</p><p>This significantly reduces the overall footprint of the module on its carrier board, letting you achieve smaller form factors for your products.

(If you do want something like that, our <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/products/1327\">Bluetooth 4.0 USB Module</a> will do the job nicely.) Instead, this is basically a minimal nRF52840 wireless microcontroller dev board on a stick. You can program it in Arduino or CircuitPython and it’s completely standalone. This could be useful for some situations where you want to have a standalone BLE device that communicates with a USB host <em>but without dealing with the operating system’s BLE stack</em>.</p><p>Each MDBT50Q-RX dongle comes pre-programmed with the TinyUF2 bootloader, which makes loading code onto it very easy (note that only the ones from Adafruit do this, its a special-order item). To enter the bootloader, hold down the dongle’s button while inserting into USB. The button can be used in Arduino/CircuitPython as an input. There’s also a single blue LED indicator. It’s all very simple but we could see situations where perhaps this acts as a beacon, a OS-less BLE interface or bridge, or a compact development board for experimenting with the nRF52840.</p><p>The blue LED is connected to P1.13, set that pin to be an output and pull low to turn on the LED</p><p>The button is connected to P0.15, set that pin to be an input with an internal pullup - when pressed the pin will go low.</p><p>Of course the best way to program these chips is with the Nordic SDK. This chip also has <a href=\"https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Arduino\">some basic Arduino support</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/tree/main/ports/nrf\">CircuitPython support</a>, and is <a href=\"https://mynewt.apache.org/latest/tutorials/blinky/nRF52.html\">supported by MyNewt</a>.</p><h2 id=\"purchase\">Purchase</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/5199\">Adafruit</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.raytac.com/product/ins.php?index_id=89\">Raytac Corporation</a></li></ul>"

It features a USB interface (using the nRF52840’s native USB support), which can be used to program, power, and communicate with the chip making it able to be used for any purpose (UART, I2C, SPI) that those of the Arduino Pro Mini could. The Pro nRF52840 Mini features a Raytac MDBT50Q-P1M module. This module connects the nRF52840 to a trace antenna, fits the IC into an FCC-approved footprint, and also includes a lot of the decoupling and timing mechanisms that would otherwise be required for a bare nRF52840 design. Also included onboard is a LiPo battery charger, a Qwiic connector, an on/off switch, a reset switch, and a user LED/button.</p><p>The board comes pre-programmed with a USB bootloader. You can develop programs for the nRF52840’s Cortex-M4 using either Arduino, CircuitPython, or C (using Nordic’s nRF5 SDK), and load that compiled code using a USB serial or mass-storage interface.</p><h2 id=\"purchase\">Purchase</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15025\">SparkFun</a></li></ul>"

The board is architecturally similar to the Adafruit Trinket M0 and ItsyBitsy M0 Express microcontroller boards with the addition of battery management and a DC motor controller. This board features JST connectors for the racer’s battery, motor output, and sensor input. LiPo battery management charge rate is 500mA. For sensor experimentation, a 3.3-volt Stemma-QT connection is available on-board. The micro-USB connector used for REPL operation, operational status data output, and battery charging. On-board flash memory size is 2MB.</p><p>The StringCar M0 Express board will not be sold. The GitHub repository will contain all design files and links for the BOM and the shared OSH Park project.</p><p>The string car racer is a simple one-motor robot that is suspended from a string using a pulley attached to the motor shaft. Its challenge is to race back and forth from one end of a taut string to the other. The fastest car wins. The controller board uses sensor switches to detect the ends of the string, calculate the string length, then control motor speed and braking to avoid string-end collisions.</p><p>The objective is to create a string car racer that can autonomously learn about its environment and adjust tradeoffs for speed and battery longevity. CircuitPython is used to easily add and interactively adjust performance features such as motor and battery efficiency, end-of-string collision avoidance, string length calculation, and predictive braking. Also, being able to watch its own battery status means that it’ll always return to the home end of the string when battery capacity begins to wane. Circuit Python also supports libraries that abstract string car functions, simplifying the primary code module to make it easier for novice programmers to get involved in customizing  string car racer operation.</p>"

The NXP iMXRT1062 is a ‘cross-over’ processor, which has the functionality of a microcontroller, at the speeds of a microcomputer. It’s perfect for when you need tons of flash, RAM and, to crunch lots of data, or when you need two full speed USB ports. It even has a graphics processor!

To help reduce power, Teensy 4.0 provides support for dynamic clock scaling. Unlike traditional microcontrollers, where changing the clock speed causes wrong baud rates and other issues, Teensy 4.0 hardware and Teensyduino’s software support for Arduino timing functions are designed to allow dynamically speed changes. Serial baud rates, audio streaming sample rates, and Arduino functions like delay() and millis(), and Teensyduino’s extensions like IntervalTimer and elapsedMillis, continue to work properly while the CPU changes speed.</p><p>Teensy 4.0 also provides a power shut off feature. By connecting a pushbutton to the On/Off pin, the 3.3V power supply can be completely disabled by holding the button for 5 seconds, and turned back on by a brief button press. If a coin cell is connected to VBAT, Teensy 4.0’s RTC also continues to keep track of date &amp; time while the power is off.</p><p>Teensy 4.0 also can also be overclocked, well beyond 600 MHz!</p><p><strong>Technical Specifications</strong></p><ul>  <li>ARM Cortex-M7 at 600 MHz</li>  <li>1024K RAM (512K is tightly coupled)</li>  <li>2048K Flash (64K reserved for recovery &amp; EEPROM emulation)</li>  <li>2 USB ports, both 480 MBit/sec</li>  <li>3 CAN Bus (1 with CAN FD)</li>  <li>2 I2S Digital Audio</li>  <li>1 S/PDIF Digital Audio</li>  <li>1 SDIO (4 bit) native SD</li>  <li>3 SPI, all with 16 word FIFO</li>  <li>3 I2C, all with 4 byte FIFO</li>  <li>7 Serial, all with 4 byte FIFO</li>  <li>32 general purpose DMA channels</li>  <li>31 PWM pins</li>  <li>40 digital pins, all interrrupt capable</li>  <li>14 analog pins, 2 ADCs on chip</li>  <li>Cryptographic Acceleration</li>  <li>Random Number Generator</li>  <li>RTC for date/time</li>  <li>Programmable FlexIO</li>  <li>Pixel Processing Pipeline</li>  <li>Peripheral cross triggering</li>  <li>Power On/Off management</li></ul><h2 id=\"purchase\">Purchase</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/4323\">Adafruit</a></li></ul>"

Please check out the <a href=\"https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy40.html\">Teensy 4.0 page for common specifications and features</a>.</p><p><strong>Memory</strong></p><p>The bottom side of Teensy 4.1 has locations to solder 2 memory chips. The smaller location is meant for a PSRAM SOIC-8 chip. The larger location is intended for QSPI flash memory.</p><p><strong>USB Host</strong></p><p>Teensy 4.1’s USB Host port allows you to connect USB devices, like keyboards and MIDI musical instruments. A 5 pin header and a USB Host cable are needed to be able to plug in a USB device. <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/?q=usb%20breakout%20cable\">You can also use one of these cables to connect to the USB pins</a>.</p><p><strong>Power Consumption &amp; Management</strong></p><p>When running at 600 MHz, the Teensy 4.1 consumes approximately 100mA current and provides support for dynamic clock scaling. Unlike traditional microcontrollers, where changing the clock speed causes wrong baud rates and other issues, Teensy 4.1 hardware and Teensyduino’s software support for Arduino timing functions are designed to allow dynamically speed changes. Serial baud rates, audio streaming sample rates, and Arduino functions like delay() and millis(), and Teensyduino’s extensions like IntervalTimer and elapsedMillis, continue to work properly while the CPU changes speed. Teensy 4.1 also provides a power shut off feature. By connecting a pushbutton to the On/Off pin, the 3.3V power supply can be completely disabled by holding the button for five seconds, and turned back on by a brief button press. If a coin cell is connected to VBAT, Teensy 4.1’s RTC also continues to keep track of date &amp; time while the power is off. Teensy 4.1 also can also be overclocked, well beyond 600MHz!</p><p>The ARM Cortex-M7 brings many powerful CPU features to a true real-time microcontroller platform. The Cortex-M7 is a dual-issue superscaler processor, meaning the M7 can execute two instructions per clock cycle, at 600MHz! Of course, executing two simultaneously depends upon the compiler ordering instructions and registers. Initial benchmarks have shown C++ code compiled by Arduino tends to achieve two instructions about 40% to 50% of the time while performing numerically intensive work using integers and pointers. The Cortex-M7 is the first ARM microcontroller to use branch prediction. On M4, loops and other code which much branch take three clock cycles. With M7, after a loop has executed a few times, the branch prediction removes that overhead, allowing the branch instruction to run in only a single clock cycle.</p><p>Tightly Coupled Memory is a special feature which allows Cortex-M7 fast single cycle access to memory using a pair of 64 bit wide buses. The ITCM bus provides a 64 bit path to fetch instructions. The DTCM bus is actually a pair of 32 bit paths, allowing M7 to perform up to two separate memory accesses in the same cycle. These extremely high speed buses are separate from M7’s main AXI bus, which accesses other memory and peripherals. 512 of memory can be accessed as tightly coupled memory. Teensyduino automatically allocates your Arduino sketch code into ITCM and all non-malloc memory use to the fast DTCM, unless you add extra keywords to override the optimized default. Memory not accessed on the tightly coupled buses is optimized for DMA access by peripherals. Because the bulk of M7’s memory access is done on the two tightly coupled buses, powerful DMA-based peripherals have excellent access to the non-TCM memory for highly efficient I/O.</p><p>Teensy 4.1’s Cortex-M7 processor includes a floating point unit (FPU) which supports both 64 bit “double” and 32 bit “float”. With M4’s FPU on Teensy 3.5 &amp; 3.6, and also Atmel SAMD51 chips, only 32 bit float is hardware accelerated. Any use of double, double functions like log(), sin(), cos() means slow software implemented math. Teensy 4.1 executes all of these with FPU hardware.</p><h2 id=\"purchase\">Purchase</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/4622\">Adafruit</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy41.html\">PJRC</a></li></ul>"

        "description": "<p>The <strong>NeoTrellis M4</strong> is an all-in-one <strong>USB + NeoPixel + Elastomer + Audio</strong> board. It’s powered by the SAMD51, a Cortex M4 core running at 120 MHz. This chip has a speedy core with CircuitPython support, hardware DSP/floating point, dual DACs and all the goodies you expect from normal chips like I2C, ADC, DMA, etc. It has a roomy 512KB of flash and 192KB of SRAM so it’s great for CircuitPython, includes a full 8MB flash chip so tons of space for files and audio clips.</p><p>The native USB port can turn it into a MIDI USB device if you like - currently that’s only supported in Arduino. Tether it to a computer or tablet, if you like. Or use it in standalone mode, as long as its powered from a USB power plug, it’ll run whatever firmware is burned into it.</p><p>OK so you’ve got this big brain, but now you need inputs and outputs! There’s a 4x8 grid of elastomer button pads with a NeoPixel nestled in the center of each one. You can read any/all button presses simultaneously thanks to the fully diode’d matrix, and also set each button color to any of 24-bit colors. The elastomer buttons are translucent so they glow beautifully when lit.</p><p>Time to make some noise! Adafruit picked the SAMD51 mostly because it has dual DACs - that’s two 12-bit, 500KSPS ‘true analog’ outputs connected them to left and right on a standard headphone jack. Since the DAC pins are also ADC pins you could also use the left/right for audio line level <em>input</em> if you so choose. You’re not going to get audiophile-quality outputs from two 12-bit DACs but you can certainly play audio clips and make beeps and bloops.</p><p>To add more interactivity, a precision triple-axis accelerometer from Analog Devices, the ADXL343, is included as well, and provides sensor information on tilt, motion, or tapping. Great for adding another dimension of data input in addition to the button pads.</p><p>Finally, a 4 pin JST hacking port is available for extra add-ons. It’s STEMMA and Grove compatible, and provides GND, 3.3V power, and two pins that can be used for I2C, ADC, or a UART. So connect some other sensor, or read stereo audio in, or maybe hack together a MIDI port. Whatever you like!</p><p>Features:</p><ul>  <li><strong>ATSAMD51 32-bit Cortex M4</strong> core running at <strong>120 MHz</strong> (32-bit, 3.3V logic and power)</li>  <li>Hardware DSP and floating point support</li>  <li><strong>512 KB</strong> flash, <strong>192 KB</strong> RAM</li>  <li>Native USB that can act as a true USB MIDI device if you like.</li>  <li><strong>8 MB SPI FLASH chip</strong> for storing files and CircuitPython code storage.</li>  <li>4x8 elastomer pads with fully diode’d matrix - no ghosting!</li>  <li>4x8 NeoPixels for each pad, glows through the elastomer buttons</li>  <li>TRRS Headphone jack with stereo DAC outputs on Left/Right, can also be stereo ADC inputs.</li>  <li>Built in <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/1063\">MAX4466 electret mic amplifier</a> for mobile phone headsets. ‘Raw’ DC level reading also available on a separate ADC</li>  <li>4-JST hacking port with 3.3V power, ground, and two GPIO that can be I2C/ADC/UART</li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.analog.com/en/products/adxl343.html\">Analog Devices ADXL343 triple-axis accelerometer</a></li>  <li>Really fun to press buttons and have sounds come out!</li></ul><h2 id=\"tutorials\">Tutorials</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neotrellis-m4\">NeoTrellis M4 Overview</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/products/4020/guides\">Projects and Guides</a></li></ul><h2 id=\"purchase\">Purchase</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/4020\">Full Kit - Adafruit</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/3938\">Mainboard - Adafruit</a></li></ul>"

It’s a tiny microcontroller board, built around the Atmel ATSAMD21, a little chip with <em>a lot</em> of power. Adafruit designed a microcontroller board that was small enough to fit into any project, and low cost enough to use without hesitation. Perfect for when you don’t want to give up your expensive dev-board and you aren’t willing to take apart the project you worked so hard to design. It’s one of the lowest-cost CircuitPython programmable boards!</p><p>Adafruit used the same form factor for <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/1500\">the original ATtiny85-based Trinket</a> and gave it an upgrade. The Trinket M0 has swapped out the lightweight ATtiny85 for a ATSAMD21E18 powerhouse. It’s just as small, and it’s easier to use, so you can do more.</p><p>The most exciting part of the Trinket M0 is that while you can use it with the Arduino IDE, it ships with CircuitPython on board. When you plug it in, it will show up as a very small disk drive with code.py on it. Edit code.py with your favorite text editor to build your project using Python, the most popular programming language. No installs, IDE or compiler needed, so you can use it on any computer, even ChromeBooks or computers you can’t install software on. When you’re done, unplug the Trinket M0 and your code will go with you. <a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-trinket-m0-circuitpython-arduino/circuitpython\">Please check out the Trinket M0 CircuitPython guide for a list of capabilities and quick-start code examples</a> - CircuitPython is easier to code but not as low-level and complete as Arduino.</p><p>Here are some of the updates you can look forward to when using Trinket M0:</p><ul>  <li>Same size, form-factor, and pinout as classic Trinket</li>  <li>Updating ATtiny85 8-bit AVR for ATSAMD21E18 32-bit Cortex M0+</li>  <li>256KB Flash - 32x as much as 8 KB on ATtiny85</li>  <li>32 KB RAM - 64x as much as 512 bytes on ATtiny85</li>  <li>48 MHz 32 bit processor - 6x as fast as ATtiny85 (not even taking into account 32-bit speedups)</li>  <li>Native USB supported by every OS - can be used in Arduino or CircuitPython as USB serial console, Keyboard/Mouse HID, even a little disk drive for storing Python scripts.

        "description": "<p><strong>Small. Yet powerful!</strong></p><p>Despite a size smaller than the ATMEGA328 which powers Arduino Uno, <strong>uChip</strong> mounts the same ATSAMD21 series of Arduino Zero! Everything that runs on Arduino Zero runs also on uChip, at the same speed! However, unlike Arduino Zero, it <strong>fits a 16-pin DIP socket</strong> and it leaves a lot of space on your breadboard. No more bulky shields or flying wires all around your breadboard!</p><p>And now uChip runs CircuitPython too!</p><p>Unlike many Arduino Zero compatible board, uChip also mounts a high efficiency buck converter, which converts the USB voltage down to 3.3V at up to 1A, which is provided on pin 16, for the external circuitry. A software-selected pass-through mode also allows to output 5V instead of 3.3V.uChip can operate also as an USB host. For this purpose, a built-in boost converter can provide up to 500mA to the external USB device, even when the input voltage is as low as 3.3V. The built-in automatic power-path management prevents external power from being fed into an USB port, when uChip is connected to a PC/Mac, and a voltage is provided also externally on pin 16.</p><p>You can program uChip using virtually any IDE, in many languages (CircuitPython too!) and you can choose of using either the USB port or an external SWD programmer.</p><p><strong>uChip Features:</strong></p><ul>  <li>CPU: 32-bit Cortex M0+ ATSAMD21-series running at 48 MHz (Arduino Zero Compatible)</li>  <li>FLASH: 256 kB (248 kB due to integrated bootloader).</li>  <li>RAM: 32 kB, zero wait states.</li>  <li>Powered via USB or externally (3.3V to 5V).</li>  <li>Integrated 500-mA boost and 1-A buck converters and automatic power switching circuitry.</li>  <li>Each converter can also be individually turned off, e.g. if you want to force power draw exclusively from external pins (self-powered device), or if you want to turn off an external USB device connected with a micro A cable.</li>  <li>When powered through the USB port, the output voltage on the power pins can be selected via software to be either 3.3V or the USB voltage (typically 5V +/- 10%).</li>  <li>Pin 15 can be configured (via SMD jumper) as an additional 3.3V auxiliary output @100mA when pin 16 is 5V (either as input or output). By default pin 15 is a regular I/O. If this feature is not used, 5/3.3V (at up to 1A) are still available on pin 16.</li>  <li>14 I/O pins (2 of them can be used to connect an external SWD programmer/debugger) and 2 power pins (VCC and GND).</li>  <li>Status LED (it can be turned on/off via software using a single instruction).</li>  <li>Multi function push button for reset/program.</li>  <li>8 12-bit ADC inputs.</li>  <li>10-bit DAC output.</li>  <li>14 external interrupt input pins.</li>  <li>Up to 5 serials between SPI, I2C and UART.</li>  <li>I2S port for audio decoders such as  UDA1334A.</li>  <li>13 PWM pins.</li>  <li>Size: 28.5 mm x 10.16 mm (1.1 “ x 0.40 “), including USB port protrusions (27.23 mm x 10.16 mm excluding USB)</li>  <li>4-layer board for improved noise performance.</li>  <li>Standards narrow-DIP footprint: 0.3” (7.62 mm) row spacing, 0.1” (2.54) pin spacing.</li>  <li>Pinout standard logic CMOS compatible: power and GND are on pin 16 and 8, so you can also emulate some 16 pin CMOS ICs (4000 and 74HC series)!</li></ul><p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong></p><ul>  <li>The uChip does not have an RGB LED.</li>  <li>The on-board LED is amber, rather than green.</li>  <li>The board’s bootloader is BOSSA-compatible, but does not support UF2, so use a CircuitPython .bin file with BOSSA.  See <a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/non-uf2-installation\">this page</a> for the general process of using BOSSA.  A Windows .bat script that demonstrates exactly how to use the BOSSAC commandline tool with uChip to flash CircuitPython is available <a href=\"https://github.com/mew-cx/circuitpython_stuff/tree/main/uChip\">here</a>; you may use it as a template and customize as needed.</li></ul><h2 id=\"purchase\">Purchase</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://shop.itaca-innovation.com\">Itaca Innovation Store</a></li></ul>"

        "description": "<p>uPico is a RP2040 powered expansion card designed to enhance the capabilities of <a href=\"https://www.clockworkpi.com/uconsole\">Clockwork’s uConsole</a>.uPico is fully compatible with RaspberryPi Pico, including LED pin(GPIO25).</p><p>All sources are open, including:</p><ul>  <li>PCB design</li>  <li>Control application code</li>  <li>Cover bracket 3D model</li></ul><p>For peripherals, there are two I2C controllers, two SPI controllers, and two UARTs that are multiplexed across the GPIO - check the pinout for what pins can be set to which. There are 16 PWM channels, each pin has a channel it can be set to (ditto on the pinout).</p><p>You’ll note there’s no I2S peripheral, or SDIO, or camera, what’s up with that? Well instead of having specific hardware support for serial-data-like peripherals like these, the RP2040 comes with the PIO state machine system which is a unique and powerful way to create custom hardware logic and data processing blocks that run on their own without taking up a CPU. For example, NeoPixels - often we bitbang the timing-specific protocol for these LEDs. For the RP2040, we instead use a PIO object that reads in the data buffer and clocks out the right bitstream with perfect accuracy. Same with I2S audio in or out, LED matrix displays, 8-bit or SPI based TFTs, even VGA! In MicroPython and CircuitPython you can create PIO control commands to script the peripheral and load it in at runtime. There are 2 PIO peripherals with 4 state machines each.</p><p><strong>There is <a href=\"https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk\">great C/C++ support</a>, unofficial (but really good) <a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/rp2040-arduino-with-the-earlephilhower-core\">Arduino support</a> an official <a href=\"https://micropython.org/download/?mcu=rp2040\">MicroPython port</a>, and a CircuitPython port!</strong> We of course <a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython\">recommend CircuitPython because we think its the easiest way to get started</a> and it has support with most our drivers, displays, sensors, and more, supported out of the box so you can follow along with our CircuitPython projects and tutorials.</p><p>While the RP2040 has lots of onboard RAM (264KB), it does not have built in FLASH memory. Instead that is provided by the external QSPI flash chip. On this board there is 2MB, which is shared between the program its running and any file storage used by MicroPython or CircuitPython. When using C/C++ you get the whole flash memory, if using Python you will have about 1 MB remaining for code, files, images, fonts, etc.</p><p><strong>RP2040 Chip features:</strong></p><ul>  <li>Dual ARM Cortex-M0+ @ 133MHz</li>  <li>264kB on-chip SRAM in six independent banks</li>  <li>Support for up to 16MB of off-chip Flash memory via dedicated QSPI bus</li>  <li>DMA controller</li>  <li>Fully-connected AHB crossbar</li>  <li>Interpolator and integer divider peripherals</li>  <li>On-chip programmable LDO to generate core voltage</li>  <li>2 on-chip PLLs to generate USB and core clocks</li>  <li>30 GPIO pins, 4 of which can be used as analog inputs</li>  <li>Peripherals</li>  <li>2 UARTs</li>  <li>2 SPI controllers</li>  <li>2 I2C controllers</li>  <li>16 PWM channels</li>  <li>USB 1.1 controller and PHY, with host and device support</li>  <li>8 PIO state machines</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://raspberrypi.org/documentation/pico/getting-started/\">Click here for the Raspberry Pi documentation.</a><a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-raspberry-pi-pico-circuitpython\">Click here for Getting Started with Raspberry Pi Pico and CircuitPython.</a></p><h2 id=\"purchase\">Purchase</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.tindie.com/products/quadbit/upico/\">Quadbit</a></li></ul>"
