  <h1>CircuitPython Libraries</h1>
  <p>
    The CircuitPython Library Bundle contains all current libraries available for
    CircuitPython. They are designed for use with CircuitPython and may or may not
    work with MicroPython. The bundle options are explained below.
  <p>
    CircuitPython libraries are written in Python. They provide additional functionality
    and support external devices, beyond what is in CircuitPython itself.
    Libraries are stored on your <b>CIRCUITPY</b> drive in a folder called <b>lib</b>.
    For more information on using and managing libraries, see the
    <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/circuitpython-libraries">Welcome To CircuitPython Guide</a>.

    <h2>Documentation</h2>
    <p>
      The
      <a href="https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/projects/bundle/en/latest/drivers.html" title="">libraries documentation page</a>
      contains a categorized list of all the CircuitPython libraries included in the following bundles,
      with links to the documentation for every library.
    <h2>Download and Installation Instructions</h2>
    <p>
      You can download all the available libraries in a zip-file bundle for all recent major
      versions of CircuitPython. These bundles are updated daily, whenever any included library is updated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The libraries in each release are supplied as <b>.mpy</b> files, which are compiled
      versions of Python source code.
      <strong>Make sure to download the bundle that matches the major version
      of your CircuitPython</strong>, because the <b>.mpy</b> files can change between versions.
      For example, if you are running 7.0.0 you should download the 7.x bundle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The precompiled <b>.mpy</b> files take up less space on your CIRCUITPY drive than the <b>.py</b> files.
      They also load faster, and for some low-RAM boards, are required because the <b>.py</b> files
      are too large to compile on the board itself.
      <strong>Unless you need the source version, choose the appropiate <b>.mpy</b> library bundle!</strong>
      If you need to compile <b>.py</b> files to <b>.mpy</b>, you can
      <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/frequently-asked-questions#how-can-i-create-my-own-mpy-files-3020687-11">run the <b>mpy-cross</b>
      cross-compiler yourself</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>To install</b>, download the appropriate bundle for your version of CircuitPython.
      Unzip the file, open the resulting folder and find the <b>lib</b> folder. Open the lib
      folder and find the library files you need to load. Create a <b>lib</b> folder on your
      CIRCUITPY drive. Copy the individual library files you need to the <b>lib</b> folder
      on your CIRCUITPY drive. More details are available
      <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/circuitpython-libraries">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can always find the
      <a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest">latest releases of the libraries bundle</a>
      on GitHub.
    </p>
    <p>
      An alternative way to download and update libraries on your board is to use the
      <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/keep-your-circuitpython-libraries-on-devices-up-to-date-with-circup">CircUp tool</a>,
      which is under development.

          <h3>Bundle for Version 7.x</h3>
          <p>
              This bundle is built for use with CircuitPython 7.x.x. If you are using
              CircuitPython 7, please download this bundle. The .mpy format has
              changed for CircuitPython 7; 6.x .mpy files are not compatible.

          <h3>Bundle for Version 8.x</h3>
          <p>
              This bundle is built for use with CircuitPython 8.x.x. If you are using
              CircuitPython 8, please download this bundle. The .mpy format has
              not changed for CircuitPython 8, so 7.x libraries are compatible.

        <h3>Python Source Bundle</h3>
        <p>
          This bundle is the latest uncompiled Python source code for every library. It is not
          intended for general use! It is only recommended if you need to edit
          a library file. This bundle works with all supported versions of CircuitPython.

        <h3>Examples Bundle</h3>
        <p>
          Every CircuitPython library has examples to go along with it. This bundle
          contains every library example. This bundle will have examples that
          require the latest version of CircuitPython, and therefore contains files
          that may not work with all versions.
