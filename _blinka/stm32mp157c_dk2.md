The STM32MP157A-DK1 and STM32MP157C-DK2 Discovery kits leverage the capabilities of STM32MP1 Series microprocessors to allow users easily develop applications using STM32 MPU OpenSTLinux Distribution software for the main processor and STM32CubeMP1 software for the co-processor.

They include an ST-LINK embedded debug tool, LEDs, push-buttons, one Ethernet 1-Gbps connector, one USB-C OTG connector, four USB Type-A Host connectors, one HDMI transceiver, one stereo headset jack with analog microphone, and one microSD connector.

To expand the functionality of the STM32MP157A-DK1 and STM32MP157C-DK2 Discovery kits, two GPIO expansion connectors are also available for ARDUINO® and Raspberry Pi shields.

Additionally, the STM32MP157C-DK2 Discovery kit features an LCD display with a touch panel, and Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy capability.
