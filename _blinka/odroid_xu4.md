ODROID-XU4 is powered by ARM® big.LITTLE™ technology, the Heterogeneous Multi-Processing (HMP) solution.

ODROID-XU4 is a new generation of computing device with more powerful, more energy-efficient hardware and a smaller form factor. Offering open source support, the board can run various flavors of Linux, including the latest Ubuntu 16.04 and Android 4.4 KitKat, 5.0 Lollipop and 7.1 Nougat.
By implementing the eMMC 5.0, USB 3.0 and Gigabit Ethernet interfaces, the ODROID-XU4 boasts amazing data transfer speeds, a feature that is increasingly required to support advanced processing power on ARM devices.
This allows users to truly experience an upgrade in computing, especially with faster booting, web browsing, networking, and 3D games.
