The ODROID-M1 is a single board computer with a wide range of useful peripherals developed for use in a variety of embedded system applications. To achieve this goal, we have developed various hardware accessories and device driver software over the past 10 months. In addition, RK3568B2, the core brain of ODROID-M1, is considered suitable for embedded application use as the SoC manufacturer (Rockchip) guarantees supply for the next 15 years. Therefore, we expect we can supply the ODROID-M1 boards to our important B2B customers until the year 2036 or beyond.

Note that RK3568B2 is a slightly modified version of the RK3568 to overcome the IC supply chain problem these days. The previous RK3568 metal-can type packaging lead time is much longer than the more common plastic package of the RK3568B2.
