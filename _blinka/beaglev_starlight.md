**The BeagleV™ - Starlight project has concluded and no units beyond the beta prototypes will be produced. This design was never sold as a product.**

[BeagleV Starlight](https://beagleboard.org/beaglev) is a Linux-capable RISC-V 64-bit dev board.

A [beta prototype version](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/BeagleV-Getting-Started/#faq) was sent to a limited number of upstream developers for software enablement.  This beta prototype used the StarFive JH7100 SoC.
