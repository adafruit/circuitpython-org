The OSD32MP1-BRK is a small flexible prototyping platform for the [STM32MP1](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32mp1-series.html) based SiP, the [OSD32MP15x](https://octavosystems.com/octavo_products/osd32mp15x/). At only 3in X 1.8in (75mm X 46mm), it provides easy access to the I/O of the STM32MP1 through a set of breadboard compatible headers. The OSD32MP1-BRK allows developers to quickly build a proof of concept that more closely resembles their actual system without the need to build their own custom hardware.

The OSD32MP1-BRK features the OSD32MP15x System in Package, a microSD slot, 32KHz crystal, a microUSB client port, and two 2×30 100 mill headers. The headers give access to 106 I/O on the STM32MP1 integrated into the OSD32MP15x SiP. It uses a 4 Layer PCB with low cost design rules and has no back side components.

Its minimal overhead and access to a wide range of I/O make the OSD32MP1-BRK the perfect platform for any designer looking for complete flexibility as they prototype their design.
