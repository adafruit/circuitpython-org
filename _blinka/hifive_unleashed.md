We founded SiFive to bring the power of open source to the semiconductor industry. We do this not only by supporting the RISC-V specification, but also by implementing the specification and getting usable chips into the hands of developers as quickly as we can. We did exactly that just over a year ago when we introduced the open source, Arduino-compatible HiFive1 dev board based on our Freedom Everywhere line of 32-bit microcontrollers. Today, we’re proud to be doing the same thing with our Freedom Unleashed 64-bit, Linux-capable system-on-chip (SoC) platform. Meet the HiFive Unleashed, the world’s first RISC-V-based, Linux-capable development board.

Industry skeptics have previously dismissed RISC-V as an academic project, low performance, and only for microcontrollers. HiFive Unleashed, featuring the SiFive Freedom U540 SoC, ends all of that. Linux and RISC-V were meant for each other, and the HiFive Unleashed dev board brings them together for the first time.

- Processor: SiFive Freedom U540 SoC
- Memory: 8 GB DDR4 with ECC
- Connectivity: Gigabit Ethernet port
- Flash: 32 MB quad SPI flash from ISSI
- Storage: microSD card for removable storage
- Expansion: FMC connector for future expansion
