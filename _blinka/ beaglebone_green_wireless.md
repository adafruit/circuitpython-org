SeeedStudio BeagleBone Green Wireless (BBGW) is a joint effort by BeagleBoard.org and Seeed Studio. It is based on the open-source hardware design of BeagleBone Black and developed into this differentiated version. SeeedStudio BeagleBone Green Wireless has included a high-performance flexible WiFi/Bluetooth interface and two Grove connectors, making it easier to connect to the large family of Grove sensors. The on-board HDMI and Ethernet are removed to make room for these wireless features and Grove connectors.
