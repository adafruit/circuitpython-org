The OSD32MP1-RED is a full featured Reference, Evaluation and Development platform for the [STM32MP1](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32mp1-series.html) based SiP, the [OSD32MP15x](https://octavosystems.com/octavo_products/osd32mp15x/). It provides access to a number of standard communication interfaces like WiFi and Bluetooth, 1Gb Ethernet, and CAN. It supports HDMI or DSI displays and has a connector for a camera. The OSD32MP1-RED expands easily by providing connectors that are compatible with Raspberry Pi, MikroElektronika mikroBUS™ Click, and STMicroelectronics Motor Control Header.

The on board eMMC comes preloaded with an Opensource Linux Distribution allowing you to begin development straight out of the box.

With its communication interfaces, peripherals, and expansion capabilities, the OSD32MP1-RED is a perfect platform for quickly developing IOT, high-end HMI, or real time control applications.
