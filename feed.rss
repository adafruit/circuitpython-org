<p>By Seeed Studio</p> <p>Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840 Sense has equipped a powerful Nordic nRF52840 MCU which is designed in a Bluetooth 5.0 module, built around 32-bit ARM® Cortex™-M4 CPU with Floating-Point Unit(FPU) operating at 64Mhz. With the capabilities of wireless connection, it still remains the Seeed Studio XIAO series classic form-factor of small and exquisite which can be used for wearable devices and Internet of Things projects. Furthermore, it only costs 5 μA in the deep sleep model and it supports battery charge management because of the BQ25101 chip.</p>

<p>In addition, it carries two extra onboard sensors. One of them is a digital microphone created through Pulse Density Modulation(PDM) module on the nRF52840 chip. It can receive audio data in real-time which allows it can be used for audio recognition. The board not only receives audio data but also can speak through the MSM261D3526H1CPM microphone. The other one is 6-axis Inertial Measurement Unit(IMU) which can be applied in TinyML projects like gesture recognition. These onboard sensors provide a great convenience for users and the ultra-small size feature of the board has still remained.</p>

<p>Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840 Sense contains a wealthy interface. The first thing to note is that the Near Field Communication(NFC) is functional on the board. Secondly, there is a tiny and elegant reset button on one side of the Type-C interface. On the other side, it is designed in a three-in-one LED along with a power LED. There are 11 digital i/o that can be used as PWM pins and 6 analog i/o that can be used as ADC pins. It supports UART, IIC, and SPI all three common serial ports. Same as Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040, it has an onboard 2 MB flash which means it can also be programmed by Arduino, MicroPython, CircuitPython, or other program languages.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bluetooth 5.0</li>
  <li>NFC</li>
  <li>21 x 17.5mm tiny board</li>
  <li>5 μA power consumption in deep sleep model</li>

              300px"
       src="/assets/images/boards/large/adafruit_feather_esp32_v2.jpg" alt="Image of Board" loading="lazy">
<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>One of our star Feathers is the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405">Adafruit HUZZAH32 ESP32 Feather</a> - with the fabulous ESP32 WROOM module on there, it makes quick work of WiFi and Bluetooth projects that take advantage of Espressifs most popular chipset. Recently we had to redesign this feather to move from the obsolete CP2104 to the available CH9102F and one thing led to another and before you know it we made a completely refreshed design: the <strong>Adafruit ESP32 Feather V2</strong>.</p>

<p>The V2 is a significant redesign, enough so we consider it a completely new product. It <em>still</em> features the ESP32 chip but has many upgrades and improvements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Compared to the original Feather with 4 MB Flash and no PSRAM, the V2 has <strong>8 MB Flash and 2 MB PSRAM</strong></li>
  <li>Additional <strong>user button tactile switch</strong> on input pin 38</li>
  <li>Additional <strong>NeoPixel mini RGB LED</strong> with controllable power pin</li>
  <li>Additional <strong>STEMMA QT</strong> port for plug and play I2C connections</li>
  <li><strong>USB Type C</strong> port instead of Micro B</li>
  <li><strong>Separate controllable 3.3V power supply for STEMMA QT</strong> to allow for ultra low power consumption even with sensors are attached</li>
  <li>Designed for low power usage: <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/5048">verified with a PPK</a> to <strong>draw 70uA from the Lipoly battery in deep sleep</strong> and 1.2mA in light sleep.</li>
  <li>ESP32 Pico module is much smaller, allowing for clear marking of all breakout pads and additional mounting holes!</li>
  <li>Upgrade the USB to serial converter from CP2102 to CH9102F which is available for purchase! The CH9102F has no issues with uploading at 921600 bps for speedy firmware loading.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, in order to add the PSRAM, and use the new Pico module which was small enough to allow all the fun extras, some of the breakout pads have changed, so here’s what you need to know:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The pin <em>numbers</em> for the I2C port (SDA, SCL), hardware UART (RX, TX), and SPI (SCK, MOSI, MISO) have changed. If your code has hardcoded use for those pins, you’ll want to replace them either by the new numbers or change the code to use the ‘pretty’ names like SDA or SCK.
When selecting the new Feather ESP32 V2 board in the Espressif board support package, the correct numbers will be substituted.
Note the names are in the same spots, we haven’t changed where the I2C/UART/SPI pins are located on the board, just which ESP32 pin numbers they are connected to in the module.</li>
  <li>The ‘corner’ pin next to TX has changed from pin 21 to 37. This pin is not used in any FeatherWings because its considered an ‘extra pin’. It’s also changed from a GPIO to input-only</li>
  <li>The remaining numbered pins and A0-A5 pins have not changed pin numbers.</li>
</ul>

<p>That module nestled in at the end of this Feather contains a dual-core ESP32 chip, 8 MB of SPI Flash, 2 MB of PSRAM, tuned PCB antenna, and all the passives you need to take advantage of this powerful new processor. The ESP32 has both WiFi <em>and</em> Bluetooth Classic/LE support. That means it’s perfect for just about any wireless or Internet-connected project.</p>

<p>Because it’s part of our <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/category/814">Feather eco-system, you can take advantage of the 50+ Wings</a> that we’ve designed to add all sorts of cool accessories. Plus that built in battery charging and monitoring you know and love with the ESP32 Feather is still there in this upgrade.</p>

<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ESP32 Dual core 240MHz Xtensa®</strong> <strong>processor</strong> - the classic dual-core ESP32 you know and love!</li>
  <li><strong>Mini module</strong> has FCC/CE certification and comes with 8 MByte of Flash and 2 MByte of PSRAM - you can have huge data buffers</li>
  <li><strong>Power options</strong> - USB type C <strong>or</strong> Lipoly battery</li>
  <li><strong>Built-in battery charging</strong> when powered over USB-C</li>
  <li><strong>LiPoly battery monitor</strong> with two 200K resistor divider</li>
  <li><strong>Reset and User</strong> (I38) buttons to reset board and as a separate input</li>
  <li><strong>High speed upload with auto-reset and serial debug</strong> with ultra-reliable CP2102N chipset.</li>
  <li><strong>STEMMA QT</strong> connector for I2C devices, with switchable power, so you can go into low power mode.</li>
  <li><strong>Charge/User</strong> LEDs + status <strong>NeoPixel</strong> with pin-controlled power for low power usage</li>
  <li><strong>Low Power friendly</strong>! In deep sleep mode we can get down to 80~100uA of current draw from the Lipoly connection. Quiescent current is from the power regulator, ESP32 chip, and Lipoly monitor. Turn off the NeoPixel and external I2C power for the lowest quiescent current draw.</li>
  <li><strong>Works with Arduino or MicroPython</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Comes fully assembled and tested, with a USB interface that lets you quickly use it with the Arduino IDE or the low-level ESP32 IDF. We also toss in some header so you can solder it in and plug into a solderless breadboard. <strong>Lipoly battery and USB cable not included</strong> (but we do have lots of options in the shop if you’d like!)</p>

However, we are super excited about the ESP32-S2’s native USB which unlocks a lot of capabilities for advanced interfacing! This ESP32-S2 mini-module we are using on the Feather comes with 4 MB flash and 2 MB PSRAM so you can buffer massive JSON files for parsing!</p>

<p>The color TFT is connected to the SPI pins, and uses additional pins for control that are not exposed to the breakout pads. <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4383">It’s the same display as you see here, with 240x135 pixels and is IPS</a> so you get bright color at any angle. The backlight is also connected to a separate pin so you can PWM the backlight up and down as desired.</p>

<p>For low power usages, the Feather has a <em>second</em> AP2112 regulator. The regulator is controlled with a GPIO pin on the enable line and can shut off power to the Stemma QT port and TFT. There is also a separate power pin for the NeoPixel that can be used to disable it for even lower quiescent power. With everything off and in deep sleep mode, the TFT feather uses about 100uA of current.</p>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>The ESP32-S3 has arrived in Feather format - and what a great way to get started with this powerful new chip from Espressif! With dual 240 MHz cores, WiFi and BLE support, and native USB, this Feather is great for powering your IoT projects.</p>

<p>That’s right - it’s the new <strong>Adafruit ESP32-*S3* Feather</strong> with dual core and native USB - <strong>this version comes with 4 MB flash, and 2 MB PSRAM</strong> compared to the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/5323">Feather ESP32-S3 with 8MB Flash / no PSRAM version here</a>.</p>

<p>Native USB means it can act like a keyboard or a disk drive, and no external USB-to-Serial converter required. WiFi and BLE mean it’s awesome for IoT projects. And Feather means it works with the large community of Feather Wings for expandability.</p>

<p>The ESP32-S3 is a highly-integrated, low-power, 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi/BLE System-on-Chip (SoC) solution that has built-in native USB as well as some other interesting new technologies like Time of Flight distance measurements and AI acceleration.

<p>The Feather ESP32-S3 has a dual-core 240 MHz chip, so it is comparable to ESP32’s dual-core. However, there is no Bluetooth <strong>Classic</strong> support, only Bluetooth LE. This chip is a great step up from the earlier ESP32-S2! This ESP32-S3 mini-module we are using on the Feather comes with 4 MB flash and 2 MB PSRAM, as well as lots of 512KB of SRAM so it’s perfect for use with CircuitPython support or any time massive buffers are needed: for fast memory access use SRAM, for slower-but-roomier access use PSRAM. It’s also great for use in ESP-IDF or with Arduino support.</p>

    <p>We’ve got a new machine here at Adafruit, it can uncover your deepest desires. Don’t believe me? I’ll turn it on right now to prove it to you! What, you want your very own soft serve ice cream machine? OK well, that’s not something we can provide. But we can provide your <em>second</em>-deepest desire: an <strong>ESP32-S*3* Feather board with a built in IPS TFT color display</strong>.

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>Aww yeah, it’s the Feather you have been waiting for! The <strong>HUZZAH32</strong> is our ESP32-based Feather, made with the official WROOM32 module. We packed everything you love about Feathers: built in USB-to-Serial converter, automatic bootloader reset, Lithium Ion/Polymer charger, and just about all of the GPIOs brought out so you can use it with any of our Feather Wings. <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/feather">We have other boards in the Feather family, check’em out here.</a></p>

<p>That module nestled in at the end of this Feather contains a dual-core ESP32 chip, 4 MB of SPI Flash, tuned antenna, and all the passives you need to take advantage of this powerful new processor. The ESP32 has both WiFi <em>and</em> Bluetooth Classic/LE support. That means it’s perfect for just about any wireless or Internet-connected project.</p>

<p>Because it’s part of our <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/category/814">Feather eco-system, you can take advantage of the 50+ Wings</a> that we’ve designed to add all sorts of cool accessories.</p>

<p>The ESP32 is a perfect upgrade from the ESP8266 that has been so popular. In comparison, the ESP32 has way more GPIO, plenty of analog inputs, two analog outputs, multiple extra peripherals (like a spare UART), two cores so you don’t have to yield to the WiFi manager, much higher-speed processor, etc. etc! We think that as the ESP32 gets traction, we’ll see more people move to this chip exclusively, as it is so full-featured.</p>

<p><strong>Please note: The ESP32 is still targeted to developers</strong>. Not all of the peripherals are fully documented with example code, and there are some bugs still being found and fixed. We got all of our Featherwings working under Arduino IDE, so you can expect things like I2C and SPI and analog reads to work. But other elements are still under development. For that reason, we recommend this Feather for makers who have some experience with microcontroller programming, and not as a first dev board.</p>

<p>Here are <a href="https://espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview">specifications from Espressif about the ESP32</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>240 MHz dual core Tensilica LX6 microcontroller with 600 DMIPS</li>
  <li>Integrated 520 KB SRAM</li>
  <li>Integrated 802.11b/g/n HT40 Wi-Fi transceiver, baseband, stack and LWIP</li>
  <li>Integrated dual mode Bluetooth (classic and BLE)</li>
  <li>4 MByte flash include in the WROOM32 module</li>
  <li>On-board PCB antenna</li>
  <li>Ultra-low noise analog amplifier</li>
  <li>Hall sensor</li>
  <li>10x capacitive touch interface</li>
  <li>32 kHz crystal oscillator</li>
  <li>3 x UARTs (only two are configured by default in the Feather Arduino IDE support, one UART is used for bootloading/debug)</li>
  <li>3 x SPI (only one is configured by default in the Feather Arduino IDE support)</li>
  <li>2 x I2C (only one is configured by default in the Feather Arduino IDE support)</li>
  <li>12 x ADC input channels</li>
  <li>2 x I2S Audio</li>
  <li>2 x DAC</li>
  <li>PWM/timer input/output available on every GPIO pin</li>
  <li>OpenOCD debug interface with 32 kB TRAX buffer</li>
  <li>SDIO controller/peripheral 50 MHz</li>
  <li>SD-card interface support</li>
</ul>

<p>Comes fully assembled and tested, with a USB interface that lets you quickly use it with the Arduino IDE or the low-level ESP32 IDF. We also toss in some header so you can solder it in and plug into a solderless breadboard. <strong>Lipoly battery and USB cable not included</strong> (but we do have lots of options in the shop if you’d like!)</p>

  <li><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/752">Optional SWD debug port can be soldered in for debug access</a></li>

  <li>3.3 V regulator with 500 mA peak current output</li>
  <li><strong>USB-C connector</strong> lets you access built-in ROM USB bootloader and serial port debugging</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Inside the RP2040 is a ‘permanent ROM’ USB UF2 bootloader.</strong> What that means is when you want to program new firmware, you can hold down the BOOTSEL button while plugging it into USB (or pulling down the RUN/Reset pin to ground) and it will appear as a USB disk drive you can drag the firmware onto. Folks who have been using Adafruit products will find this very familiar - we use the technique on all our native-USB boards. Just note you don’t double-click reset, instead hold down BOOTSEL during boot to enter the bootloader!</p>

<p>The RP2040 is a powerful chip, which has the clock speed of our M4 (SAMD51), and two cores that are equivalent to our M0 (SAMD1). Since it is an M0 chip, it does not have a floating point unit, or DSP hardware support - so if you’re doing something with heavy floating-point math, it will be done in software and thus not as fast as an M4. For many other computational tasks, you’ll get close-to-M4 speeds!</p>

<p>For peripherals, there are two I2C controllers, two SPI controllers, and two UARTs that are multiplexed across the GPIO - check the pinout for what pins can be set to which. There are 16 PWM channels, each pin has a channel it can be set to (ditto on the pinout).</p>

<p>You’ll note there’s no I2S peripheral, or SDIO, or camera, what’s up with that? Well instead of having specific hardware support for serial-data-like peripherals like these, the RP2040 comes with the PIO state machine system which is a unique and powerful way to create custom hardware logic and data processing blocks that run on their own without taking up a CPU. For example, NeoPixels - often we bitbang the timing-specific protocol for these LEDs. For the RP2040, we instead use PIO object that reads in the data buffer and clocks out the right bitstream with perfect accuracy. Same with I2S audio in or out, LED matrix displays, 8-bit or SPI based TFTs, even VGA! In MicroPython and CircuitPython you can create PIO control commands to script the peripheral and load it in at runtime. There are 2 PIO peripherals with 4 state machines each.</p>

<p>There is great <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk">C/C++ support</a>, unofficial (but really good) <a href="https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico">Arduino support</a>, an official <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/micropython">MicroPython port</a>, and a <a href="/downloads">CircuitPython port</a>. We of course <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython">recommend CircuitPython because we think it’s the easiest way to get started</a> and it has support with most of our drivers, displays, sensors, and more, supported out of the box so you can follow along with our CircuitPython projects and tutorials.</p>

<p>While the RP2040 has lots of onboard RAM (264KB), it does not have built-in FLASH memory. Instead, that is provided by the external QSPI flash chip. <strong>On this board there is 8 MB</strong>, which is shared between the program it’s running and any file storage used by MicroPython or CircuitPython. When using C/C++ you get the whole flash memory, if using Python you will have about 7 MB remaining for code, files, images, fonts, etc.</p>

<p><strong>RP2040 Chip features:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Dual ARM Cortex-M0+ @ 133 MHz</li>
  <li>264 kB on-chip SRAM in six independent banks</li>
  <li>Support for up to 16 MB of off-chip Flash memory via dedicated QSPI bus</li>

  <li>Interpolator and integer divider peripherals</li>
  <li>On-chip programmable LDO to generate core voltage</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>Home is where the heart is…it’s also where all we keep all our electronic bits. So why not wire it up with sensors and actuators to turn our house into an electronic wonderland. Whether it’s tracking the environmental temperature and humidity in your laundry room, or notifying you when someone is detected in the kitchen, to sensing when a window was left open, or logging when your cat leaves through the pet door, this board is designed to make it way easy to make WiFi-connected home automation projects.</p>

<p>The main processor is the ESP32-S2, which has the advantage of the low cost and power of the ESP32 with the flexibility of CircuitPython support thanks to native USB support. There’s also Arduino support for this chip, and many existing ESP32 projects seem to run as-is. Note this chip does not have BLE support, but for WiFi projects its great. You can use it to connect to IoT services or just the Internet in general, with SSL support and this module has plenty of PSRAM for any kind of data processing.</p>

<p>The board is designed to make it easy to wire up sensors with little or no soldering. There are built in sensors for light, pressure, humidity and temperature sensors. <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/category/1019">Three JST PH plugs allow for quick connection of STEMMA boards</a> that use digital or analog I/O, and there’s a <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/category/620">STEMMA QT port for any I2C devices</a>.</p>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>A new chip means a new ItsyBitsy, and the Raspberry Pi RP2040 is no exception. When we saw this chip we thought “this chip is going to be awesome when we give it the ItsyBitsy teensy-weensy Treatment” and so we did! This Itsy’ features the RP2040, and all niceties you know and love about the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/category/1008">ItsyBitsy family</a>.</p>

<p>What’s smaller than a Feather but larger than a Trinket? It’s an Adafruit ItsyBitsy RP2040 featuring the Raspberry Pi RP2040! Small, powerful, with a ultra fast duel Cortex M0+ processor running at 125 MHz - this microcontroller board is perfect when you want something very compact, with lots of horsepower and a bunch of pins. This Itsy has sports car speed, but SUV roominess with 4 MB of FLASH and 264 KB of SRAM.</p>

<p>ItsyBitsy RP2040 is only 1.4” long by 0.7” wide, but has 6 power pins, 23 digital GPIO pins (4 of which can be analog in and 16x PWM out). It’s the same chip as the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/4884">Feather RP2040</a> and <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/4883">Raspberry Pi Pico</a> <em>but really really small</em>. So it’s great once you’ve finished up a prototype, and want to make the project much smaller. It even comes with 4MB of SPI Flash built in, for data logging, file storage, or CircuitPython/MicroPython code.</p>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>A wild Kee Boar appears! It’s a shiny <strong>KB2040</strong>! An Arduino Pro Micro-shaped board for Keebs with RP2040. (#keeblife 4 evah) A lot of folks like using Adafruit parts for their Keeb builds – but with the ItsyBitsy not being pin-compatible with the Pro Micro pinout, it really wasn’t very easy without some sort of adapter plate.</p>

<p>Now we’re seeing lots of people use CircuitPython for keebs, which is awesome! So why not try our hands at spinning up a pro-micro-compatible RP2040 board? The RP2040 is plenty powerful, low-cost, and makes for an excellent keeb driver chip.</p>

<p>We mixed together what we liked most about the SparkFun Pro Micro RP2040 (<strong>Qwiic / STEMMA QT I2C port on the end</strong>, so good!) and Elite-C (<strong>castellated pads &amp; pins for D+ and D-</strong>) and our existing RP2040 boards (<strong>boot button can be used for user, 8MB QSPI flash, onboard NeoPixel, jumper for skipping the diode/fuse for high power RGB LEDs or USB hosting</strong>). We even got it to all fit on a 2-layer PCB with 7/7 routing – just needed to make the smallest caps and resistors 0402.</p>

<p>With 20 GPIO available (18 on castellated pins, 2 on STEMMA QT port) you can easily make up to 100-keys matrices, or common 65% 5x15 layouts. <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4209">Use a plug-and-play QT cable to connect to the last two pins</a> without having to do any desoldering/rework.</p>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>This board is designed to be a thin, bluetooth-enabled driver board for our <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/5210">Adafruit LED Glasses</a> RGB LED matrix. That said, it’s a perfectly good stand-alone development board for the Nordic nRF52840 chipset, with a very slim design, optional LiPo battery support, a few sensors, and a Stemma QT port for adding other devices or sensors with I2C plug-and-play.</p>

<p>The driver <em>looks</em> a little like a Feather but it does not have any breakout pins to keep it very compact. If you need access to GPIO pins, we recommend an <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4481">nRF52840 ItsyBitsy</a>, <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4062">nRF52840 Feather</a> or <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4516">Feather Sense</a>.</p>

<p>In exchange for GPIO outputs, we added some sensors on instead: each board <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2809">comes with a LIS3DH triple-axis accelerometer</a> that can be used for motion and orientation sensing, <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3492">and a PDM digital microphone</a> for audio sensing. To add more sensors or connect to the LED Glasses front panel, there’s a <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/category/1018">STEMMA QT connector for plug-and-play I2C support</a>.</p>

<p>Unlike our Itsy/Feather boards, this driver also comes with a proper on/off switch which will cut power to the microcontroller and external sensors. There’s optional LiPo charge support because we think that many folks will want to power this board with AAA or coin cell batteries. If you’d like to enable LiPo charging, short the jumper on the back and then make sure to only use 4.2 V/3.7 V rechargeable batteries in the battery port.</p>

<p>The nRF52840 is a lovely Bluetooth LE microcontroller, with good support in both Arduino and CircuitPython. It feathers a Cortex M4 processor with 1 MB of FLASH and 256 KB of SRAM. Best of all, it’s got that native USB! Finally, no need for a separate USB serial chip like CP2104 or FT232. Serial is handled as a USB CDC descriptor, and the chip can act like a keyboard, mouse, MIDI device or even disk drive. <a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_TinyUSB_Arduino">This chip has TinyUSB support</a> - that means you can use it with Arduino as a native USB device and act as UART (CDC), HID, Mass Storage, MIDI and more!</p>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>Strap yourself in, we’re launching in T-minus 10 seconds…Destination? A new Class M planet called MACROPAD! M here, stands for Microcontroller because this 3x4 keyboard controller features the newest technology from the Raspberry Pi sector: say hello to the RP2040. It’s speedy little microcontroller with lots of GPIO pins and a 64 times more RAM than the Apollo Guidance Computer. We added 8 MB of flash memory for plenty of storage.</p>

<p>Get ready to upgrade your desk’s mission control station with a CircuitPython or Arduino powered Macropad - complete with 12 buttons, OLED display, speaker and rotary encoder. Customize it for your spacecraft to help guide you through the great reaches of the unknown. (Or just have it type out your favorite emojis.)</p>

<p>Each of the 12 sockets can accept a Cherry MX-compatible key switch. No soldering required, just snap it in! Use any key switch you like - but we recommend ones with slots that will allow the matching twelve NeoPixels underneath to shine through.</p>

<p>This space-ship is also fitted with a 128x64 monochome OLED for a crisp heads-up display that can be used in Arduino or CircuitPython to display keymaps, stats, computer performance, etc. There’s also a rotary encoder with push-button soldered in. Twist and turn it or push to change volume or monitor brightness or scroll: whatever you like! A tiny speaker can give audio feedback or play fun bleepy tunes.</p>

<p>Want to add more hardware? No worries - <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/category/1018">a STEMMA QT port on the side lets you connect any I2C add-on peripherals from the massive STEMMA QT / Qwiic family of plug in boards</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Please note, the RP2040 chip does not currently have QMK support</strong> - this macropad is designed to be programmed in Arduino or CircuitPython! If QMK eventually does add RP2040 as a supported chipset (no ETA and no plans that we know of), we’ll update this page.</p>

<h2 id="technical-details">Technical details</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Raspberry Pi RP2040 Chip + 8MB Flash memory</strong> - Dual core Cortex M0+ at ~130MHz with 264 KB or RAM. Runs CircuitPython, Arduino or MicroPython with ease and lots of space for development code and files</li>
  <li><strong>USB C Connector for Power/Data</strong> - of course this can act as an HID device but also can be MIDI, UART, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>3x4 Mechanical key switch sockets</strong> - accepts any Cherry MX-compatible switches. Individually tied to GPIO pins (not matrix wired)</li>
  <li><strong>One NeoPixel RGB LED per switch</strong>, on north side</li>
  <li><strong>Rotary encoder</strong>, 20 detents per rotation, with push-switch on GPIO pin. Push switch is also used for entering bootloader mode when held down on power-up or reset.</li>
  <li><strong>128x64 SH1106 Monochrome OLED display</strong> - On high speed hardware SPI port for quick updates</li>
  <li><strong>8 mm Speaker/Buzzer</strong> - With Class D amplifier and RC filter, can be used to make simple beeps and sounds effects.</li>
  <li><strong>STEMMA QT Connector</strong> - Allows adding any I2C sensors/displays/devices with plug-and-play cables.</li>
  <li><strong>Reset button -</strong> On the side, for quick restarting of code</li>
  <li><strong>Four M3 mounting bosses</strong> - Make custom enclosures easily</li>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>The Adafruit MagTag combines the new ESP32-S2 wireless module and a 2.9” grayscale E-Ink display to make a low-power IoT display that can show data on its screen even when power is removed! The ESP32-S2 is great because it builds on the years of code and support for the ESP32 and also adds native USB support so you can use this board with Arduino <em>or</em> CircuitPython!</p>

<p>We designed this board to be low-power friendly - with a spot for a 350 or 420 mAh battery and built in battery charging over USB C. During deep sleep, with the NeoPixels and speaker amplifier disabled, we measured 250uA power draw so you can run for a few weeks between charges.</p>

<p>And of course, the Mag in MagTag stands for <em>magnetic</em>. <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4631">We have four M3 standoffs that will work perfectly with these mini magnet feet</a>. (Originally they’re designed for RGB Matrices but they’ll do an excellent job here as well). Screw on the feet and you can attach this display to a metallic shelf, fridge, or bench.</p>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>It’s half USB Key, half Adafruit Trinket, half mechanical keeb<em>…</em>it’s <strong>NeoKey Trinkey</strong>, the circuit board with a Trinket M0 heart, a NeoPixel glow, and a Cherry MX-compatible. We were inspired by single-key macro pads we’ve seen. So we thought, hey what if we made something like that that plugs right into your computer’s USB port, with a fully programmable color NeoPixel? And this is what we came up with!</p>

<p>The PCB is designed to slip into any USB A port on a computer or laptop. There’s an ATSAMD21 microcontroller on board with just enough circuitry to keep it happy. One pin of the microcontroller connects to a Cherry MX-compatible switch. Another connects to a NeoPixel LED. The third pin can be used as a capacitive touch input. A reset button lets you enter bootloader mode if necessary. That’s it!</p>

<p>The SAMD21 can run CircuitPython or Arduino very nicely - with existing NeoPixel and our FreeTouch libraries for the capacitive touch input. Over the USB connection you can have serial, MIDI or HID connectivity. The NeoKey Trinkey is perfect for simple projects that can use a few user inputs and colorful output. Maybe you’ll set it up as a macro-controller, or a password-enterer, or an Escape key for your MacBook.</p>

<p><strong>Please note this board DOES NOT come with a key soldered in - we expect folks to pick their favorite MX-compatible key switch and key cap! Two solder points and you’re done.</strong></p>

<p>We think it’s just an adorable little board, small and durable and inexpensive enough that it could be a first microcontroller board, or inspiration for advanced developers to make something simple and fun.</p>

The Proximity Trinkey is perfect for simple projects that want to use motion, light or color sensing as an input to make fun and intuitive user experiences.</p>

<p>The star of this Trinkey is the APDS9960 from Avago Technologies, which has a few different capabilities thanks to integrated IR LED, photodiodes, and RGB sensing:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Proximity sensing</strong> up to about 6” away by bouncing IR light off an object</li>
  <li><strong>RGB color sensing</strong> can detect color when light refects off of an object - good for bright colorful items like LEGO bricks</li>
  <li><strong>Ambient light sensing</strong> - how dark or bright is it in the room?</li>
  <li><strong>Basic gesture sensing</strong> using 4 cardinal locations of photodiodes - this sensor is a little tough to use but it does work with practice</li>
  <li>Configurable interrupt pin that can fire when a certain proximity threshold is broken, or when a color sensor breaks a certain threshold.</li>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>This dev board is like when you’re watching a super-hero movie and the protagonist shows up in a totally amazing costume in the third act and you’re like ‘OMG! That’s the hero and they’re here to kick some serious butt!” but in this case its a microcontroller.</p>

<p>This QT Py board is a thumbnail-sized PCB that features the <strong>ESP32 Pico V3 02</strong>, an all-in-one chip that has an <strong>ESP32 chip with dual-core 240MHz Tensilica processor</strong>, <strong>WiFi</strong> and <strong>Bluetooth classic + BLE</strong>, adds a bunch of required passives and oscillator, <strong>8 MB of Flash memory</strong> and <strong>2 MB of PSRAM</strong>. We add a USB to serial converter chip, some more passives, an antenna, USB C, buttons, NeoPixel and QT connector to outfit this super-hero chip for any task you want to throw it at.</p>

<p>At the core of ESP32-PICO-V3-02 is the ESP32 (ECO V3) chip, which is a single 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth combo chip designed with TSMC’s 40 nm low-power technology. ESP32-PICO-V3-02 integrates all peripheral components seamlessly, including a crystal oscillator, flash, PSRAM, filter capacitors, and RF matching links in one single package. This makes it perfect for stuffing into such a small space as the QT Py.</p>

<p><strong>Please note</strong> the QT Py ESP32 Pico does not have native USB support - instead there’s a USB to serial converter chip. This means it <em>cannot</em> act like a USB keyboard or mouse - but it does have BLE and BT classic so you could wireless.</p>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>What’s life without a little RISC? This miniature dev board is perfect for small projects: it comes with <a href="http://adafruit.com/stemma">our favorite connector - the STEMMA QT</a>, a chainable I2C port, WiFi, Bluetooth LE, and plenty of FLASH and RAM memory for many IoT projects. What a cutie pie! Or is it… a <strong>QT Py</strong>? This diminutive dev board comes with a RISC-V IoT microcontroller, the <strong>ESP32-C3</strong>!</p>

<p>ESP32-C3 is a low-cost microcontroller from Espressif that supports 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth® Low Energy (Bluetooth LE). It has built-in USB-to-Serial, but <em>not</em> native USB - it cannot act as a keyboard or disk drive. The chip used here has 4MB of Flash memory, 400 KB of SRAM and can easily handle TLS connections.</p>

<p>The ESP32-C3 integrates a rich set of peripherals, ranging from UART, I2C, I2S, remote control peripheral, LED PWM controller, general DMA controller, TWAI controller, USB Serial/JTAG controller, temperature sensor, and ADC. It also includes SPI, Dual SPI, and Quad SPI interfaces. There is no DAC or native capacitive touch.</p>

<p>There’s a minimum number of pins on this chip, it’s specifically designed to be low cost and for simpler projects than ESP32-Sx or ESP32 classics with their large number of GPIO. Think of it more as an intended replacement to the ESP8266 than to the ESP32!</p>

<p>With its state-of-the-art power and RF performance, this SoC is an ideal choice for a wide variety of application scenarios relating to the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/category/342">Internet of Things (IoT)</a>, <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/category/65">wearable electronics</a>, and smart homes.</p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> The C3 uses <strong>RISC V</strong> as a core, not Tensilica, and has Bluetooth LE (not classic!). The BLE core supports BT version 5 including Mesh</p>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>What has your favorite Espressif WiFi microcontroller, comes with <a href="http://adafruit.com/stemma">our favorite connector - the STEMMA QT</a>, a chainable I2C port, and has lots of Flash and RAM memory for your next IoT project? What will make your next IoT project flyyyyy? What a cutie pie! Or is it… a <strong>QT Py</strong>? This diminutive dev board comes with one of our new favorite lil chips, the <strong>ESP32-S2</strong>!</p>

<p>The ESP32-S2 is a highly-integrated, low-power, 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi System-on-Chip (SoC) solution that now has <strong>built-in native USB</strong> as well as some other interesting new technologies like Time of Flight distance measurements. With its state-of-the-art power and RF performance, this SoC is an ideal choice for a wide variety of application scenarios relating to the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/category/342">Internet of Things (IoT)</a>, <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/category/65">wearable electronics</a>, and smart homes.</p>

<p><strong>Please note</strong> the QT Py ESP32-S2 has a single-core 240 MHz chip, so it won’t be as fast as ESP32’s with dual-core. Also, there is no Bluetooth support. However, we are super excited about the ESP32-S2’s native USB which unlocks a lot of capabilities for advanced interfacing! This ESP32-S2 mini-module we are using on the QT Py comes with 4 MB flash and 2 MB PSRAM so you can buffer massive JSON files for parsing!</p>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>What a cutie pie! Or is it… a QT Py? This diminutive dev board comes with one of our new favorite chip, the RP2040. It’s been made famous in the new <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/pico">Raspberry Pi Pico</a> <em>and</em> our <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/product/4884">Feather RP2040</a> and <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/product/4888">ItsyBitsy RP2040</a>, but what if we wanted something really <em>smol?</em></p>

<p>A new chip means a new QT Py, and the Raspberry Pi RP2040 is no exception. When we saw this chip we thought “this chip is going to be awesome when we give it the cuuutie QT Py Treatment”, and so we did! This QT Py features the RP2040, <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/category/4600">and all niceties you know and love about the original QT Py</a>.</p>

<p>The star of the QT Py is <a href="http://adafruit.com/stemma">our favorite connector - the STEMMA QT</a>, a chainable I2C port that can be used with <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/category/620">any of our STEMMA QT sensors and accessories</a>. Having this connector means you don’t need to do any soldering to get started.</p>

<p>What can you pop into the QT port? How about <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/?q=qt+oled&amp;main_page=category&amp;cPath=1005&amp;sort=BestMatch">OLEDs</a>! <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/?q=qt+imu&amp;main_page=category&amp;cPath=1005&amp;sort=BestMatch">Inertial Measurment Units</a>! <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/?q=qt+sensor&amp;main_page=category&amp;cPath=1005&amp;sort=BestMatch">Sensors a-plenty</a>. All plug-and-play thanks to the innovative chainable design: <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic">SparkFun Qwiic</a>-compatible <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt">STEMMA QT</a> connectors for the I2C bus so you don’t even need to solder. Just plug in a compatible cable and attach it to your MCU of choice, and you’re ready to load up some software and measure some light.</p>

<p>Use any <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic">SparkFun Qwiic</a> boards! <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4528">Seeed Grove I2C boards</a> will also work with this adapter cable.</p>

<p>There is great <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk">C/C++ support</a>, unofficial (but really good) <a href="https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico">Arduino support</a>, an official <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/micropython">MicroPython port</a>, and a <a href="/downloads">CircuitPython port</a>. We of course <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython">recommend CircuitPython because we think it’s the easiest way to get started</a> and it has support with most of our drivers, displays, sensors, and more, supported out of the box so you can follow along with our CircuitPython projects and tutorials.</p>

<p>Pinout and shape is <a href="https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO/">Seeed Xiao</a> compatible, with castellated pads so you can solder it to a PCB with a cut out to allow the bottom components some breathing room. In addition to the QT connector, we also added an <strong>RGB NeoPixel</strong> (with a controllable power pin to allow for ultra-low-power usage), <strong>and both boot-mode and reset buttons</strong> (great for restarting your program or entering the bootloader). This QT Py comes with loose 0.1” headers you can solder in for breadboard use.</p>

<p>While the RP2040 has lots of onboard RAM (264KB), it does not have built-in FLASH memory. Instead, that is provided by the external QSPI flash chip. On this board there is 4MB, which is shared between the program it’s running and any file storage used by MicroPython or CircuitPython. When using C/C++ you get the whole flash memory, if using Python you will have about 3 MB remaining for code, files, images, fonts, etc.</p>

<h2 id="technical-details">Technical details</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Same size, form-factor, and pin-out as <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4600">our SAMD-based QT Py</a></li>
  <li><strong>USB-C connector</strong> - <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4299">If you have only Micro B cables, this adapter will come in handy</a>!</li>
  <li><strong>RP2040 32-bit Cortex M0+</strong> dual-core running at ~125 MHz @ 3.3 V logic and power</li>
  <li>264 KB RAM</li>
  <li><strong>8 MB SPI FLASH</strong> chip for storing files and CircuitPython/MicroPython code storage. No EEPROM</li>
  <li>Native USB supported by every OS - can be used in Arduino or CircuitPython as USB serial console, MIDI, Keyboard/Mouse HID, even a little disk drive for storing Python scripts.</li>
  <li>Can be used with <strong>Arduino IDE</strong> or <strong>CircuitPython</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Built-in RGB NeoPixel LED</strong></li>
  <li>13 GPIO pins (11 breakout pads and two QT pads):
    <ul>
      <li>4 12-bit ADCs (one more than Pico)</li>
      <li>2 I2C ports (one on the QT connector, one on the breakout pads)</li>
      <li>SPI and UART peripherals, in standard QT Py locations,</li>
      <li>PWM outputs on every IO pin - for servos, LEDs, etc</li>
      <li>There are 6 GPIO in consecutive order for PIO compatibility</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>3.3 V regulator with <a href="https://www.diodes.com/assets/Datasheets/AP2112.pdf"><strong>600 mA peak output</strong></a></li>
  <li><strong>Both Reset button and Bootloader select buttons</strong> for quick restarts (no unplugging-replugging to relaunch code)</li>
  <li><strong>Really really small</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Inside the RP2040 is a ‘permanent ROM’ USB UF2 bootloader</strong>. What that means is when you want to program new firmware, you can hold down the BOOT button while plugging it into USB (or pulling down the RUN/Reset pin to ground) and it will appear as a USB disk drive you can drag the firmware onto. Folks who have been using Adafruit products will find this very familiar - we use the technique on all our native-USB boards. Just note you don’t double-click reset, instead hold down BOOTSEL during boot to enter the bootloader!</p>

<p>The RP2040 is a powerful chip, which has the clock speed of our M4 (SAMD51), and two cores that are equivalent to our M0 (SAMD21). Since it is an M0 chip, it does not have a floating point unit or DSP hardware support - so if you’re doing something with heavy floating point math, it will be done in software and thus not as fast as an M4. For many other computational tasks, you’ll get close-to-M4 speeds!</p>

<p>For peripherals, there are two I2C controllers, two SPI controllers, and two UARTs that are multiplexed across the GPIO - check the pinout for what pins can be set to which. There are 16 PWM channels, each pin has a channel it can be set to (ditto on the pinout).</p>

<p>You’ll note there’s no I2S peripheral, or SDIO, or camera, what’s up with that? Well, instead of having specific hardware support for serial-data-like peripherals like these, the RP2040 comes with the PIO state machine system which is a unique and powerful way to create <em>custom hardware logic and data processing blocks</em> that run on their own without taking up a CPU. For example, NeoPixels - often we bitbang the timing-specific protocol for these LEDs. For the RP2040, we instead use PIO object that reads in the data buffer and clocks out the right bitstream with perfect accuracy. <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/tree/master/pio">Same with I2S audio in or out, LED matrix displays, 8-bit or SPI based TFTs, even VGA</a>! In MicroPython and CircuitPython you can create PIO control commands to script the peripheral and load it in at runtime. There are 2 PIO peripherals with 4 state machines each.</p>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>It’s half USB Key, half Adafruit Trinket, half rotary encoder<em>…</em>it’s <strong>Rotary Trinkey</strong>, the circuit board with a Trinket M0 heart, a NeoPixel glow, and a rotary encoder body. <a href="https://twitter.com/todbot/status/1365107469345648643">We were inspired by this project from TodBot where a rotary encoder was soldered onto a QT Py</a>. So we thought, hey what if we made something like that that plugs right into your computer’s USB port, with a fully programmable color NeoPixel? And this is what we came up with!</p>

<p>The PCB is designed to slip into any USB A port on a computer or laptop. There’s an ATSAMD21 microcontroller on board with just enough circuitry to keep it happy. Three pins of the microcontroller connects to a rotary encoder with built-in push switch. Another connects to a NeoPixel LED. Finally, one pin can be used as a capacitive touch input. A reset button lets you enter bootloader mode if necessary. That’s it!</p>

<p>Rotary encoders are soooo much fun! Twist em this way, then twist them that way. Unlike potentiometers, they go all the way around, and often have little detents for tactile feedback. But, if you just want to add one to your computer, you know its a real pain. This board is designed to make it very easy.</p>

<p>The SAMD21 can run CircuitPython or Arduino very nicely - with existing Rotary, NeoPixel and our FreeTouch libraries for the capacitive touch input. Over the USB connection you can have serial, MIDI or HID connectivity. The Rotary Trinkey is perfect for simple projects that use a rotating user input and underlit colorful output. Maybe you’ll set it up as a volume knob, scroll wheel, or zoom macro tool - whatever you like!</p>

<p><strong>Please note this board DOES NOT come with a rotary encoder soldered in - we expect folks to pick their favorite rotary encoder and knob! Five solder points and you’re done.</strong></p>

<p>We think it’s just an adorable little board, small and durable and inexpensive enough that it could be a first microcontroller board or inspiration for advanced developers to make something simple and fun.</p>

<ul>
  <li>ATSAMD21E18 32-bit Cortex M0+ - 48 MHz 32 bit processor with 256KB Flash and 32 KB RAM</li>
  <li>Native USB supported by every OS - can be used in <strong>Arduino or CircuitPython</strong> as USB serial console, MIDI, Keyboard/Mouse HID, even a little disk drive for storing Python scripts.</li>
  <li>Can be used with Arduino IDE or CircuitPython</li>
  <li>Single under-lighting RGB NeoPixel LED</li>
  <li>One Capacitive Touch pad</li>
  <li>Standard ‘5-pin’ rotary encoder footprint can be used with any “PEC11” or “PEC12” compatible rotary encoder.</li>
  <li>Cute &amp; keychain-friendly!</li>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>It’s half USB Key, half Adafruit Trinket, half mini slide pot<em>…</em> it’s <strong>Slider Trinkey</strong>, the circuit board with a Trinket M0 heart, NeoPixel glow, and a 35mm long 10KΩ slide potentiometer.</p>

<p>The PCB is designed to slip into any USB A port on a computer or laptop. There’s an ATSAMD21 microcontroller on board with just enough circuitry to keep it happy. One pin of the microcontroller connects to the middle of the slide potentiometer as an analog input. Another connects to two NeoPixel LEDs. The third pin can be used as a capacitive touch input.

<p>The SAMD21 can run CircuitPython or Arduino very nicely - with existing NeoPixel and our FreeTouch libraries for the capacitive touch input.

Maybe you’ll set it up as a monitor brightness adjuster, or volume control, or color picker.</p>

<p><strong>Please note this board DOES come with a pre-soldered slide pot</strong> (there’s really only one that fits and we happen to stock it) Since we use a PCB with a USB A shape, its possible to accidentally yank the board out if you push the potentiometer all way way out and then <em>keep pushing out</em>. So be kind and careful with your Slider Trinkey! It isnt meant for yanking.</p>

<p>By Alorium Technology, LLC</p> <p>The Evo M51 is an FPGA-enhanced Feather compatible compute module from Alorium Technology that features a 32-bit SAMD51 microcontroller along with an Intel MAX 10 FPGA.</p>

<p>Designed for use as an embeddable system-on-module, all of the standard Feather I/O are also routed to castellated vias along the edge of the board. There are 34 additional castellated digital I/O connected to the FPGA and accessible via the SAMD51.</p>

<p>Most digital I/O connections are routed through the FPGA to and from the primary and castellated I/O. This provides the opportunity for developers to immediately capture inputs or drive outputs from the FPGA without requiring direct interaction with the SAMD controller.</p>

<p>Evo M51 will support Alorium Technology-supplied pre-built FPGA images that target specific application use cases. In addition, designers will have the option to develop their own custom logic blocks and integrate them into the top-level MAX 10 FPGA design.</p>

<p>Evo was specifically designed to support running CircuitPython. It is also programmable with Arduino just like many other boards based upon the SAMD51.</p>

<p>By DFRobot</p> <p>Beetle ESP32-C3, mainly intended for IoT applications, is a controller based on
ESP32-C3 RISC-V 32bit single-core processor.</p>

<p>On a coin-size board of 25*20.5 mm, there are up to 13 IO ports broken out, so
you don’t have to worry about running out of IO ports when making projects.
Meanwhile, li-ion battery charging management function is integrated on the
board which allows to directly connect li-ion battery without extra modules,
while ensuring the application size and safety.</p>

<p>The equipped expansion board for Beetle ESP32-C3 brings out more power sources

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>The Black Lives Matter Education &amp; Workshop Kit is an open-source design the Adafruit team published during the peaceful demonstrations for social justice in the summer of 2020 (https://github.com/adafruit/BLM-Badge-PCB). As a company and culture we came together to make our voices heard, share the pain we all had, the anger, and then work together for equality and justice in our communities (https://www.adafruit.com/blacklivesmatter). We listened to each other, we marched, we donated our time, resources, we distributed PPE at community events, we came together.</p>

<p>The kit is a snapshot in time, a time capsule of what we did together, and what we can build together going forward. The kit can be used for learn-to-code events remotely or in person when gatherings are safe post-COVID. We wanted to make something that would continue to emphasize the moment, is a movement.</p>

<p>The kits will never be for sale from Adafruit, they will be donated to learning-to-code organizations, social justice groups, and events.</p>

<p>This education and workshop kit is build around a Cortex M0+ processor that can run Arduino or CircuitPython.</p>

<p>By JPConstantineau</p> <p>The BlueMicro833 is a nRF52833 controller with the footprint of an Arduino Pro Micro and a USB-C connector. It uses the EByte E73-2GM08S1E nRF52833 module, has a Neopixel and software controller 3.3 V regulator that can turn on/off power to external devices. It’s based on the BlueMicro840 design but uses the internal voltage regulator to run. Just like other Bluemicros, there is a LiPo battery charger on board.</p>

<p>Many DIY keyboards use the Arduino Pro Micro or the Arduino Micro as their microcontroller. These don’t support BLE communications natively. Because the nRF52 chips have a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4F processor, they have plenty of processing power compared to the traditional AVR chips. The BlueMicro boards were inspired from the Adafruit nrf52 feathers but made to be used directly in DIY keyboards as a replacement for the atmega32u4 based controllers.</p>

<p>By Invector Labs</p> <p>The Challenger 840 BLE board is an Arduino/Circuitpython compatible Adafruit Feather format micro controller board packed with loads of functionality for your projects that require low power consumption and a BLE connection.</p>

<p>The main controller of this board is the Nordic Semiconductor nRF52840 with 1MByte of FLASH memory and 256KByte of SRAM. The nRF52840 SoC is the most advanced member of the nRF52 Series. It meets the challenges of sophisticated applications that need protocol concurrency and a rich and varied set of peripherals and features. It offers generous memory availability for both Flash and RAM, which are prerequisites for such demanding applications.</p>

<p>The nRF52840 is fully multiprotocol capable with full protocol concurrency. It has protocol support for Bluetooth LE, Bluetooth mesh, Thread, Zigbee, 802.15.4, ANT and 2.4 GHz proprietary stacks.</p>

As of yet we haven’t seen any shortage of micro USB cables but we are not getting any new ones any more and old ones do break occasionally. So we decided to go for a USB Type C connector for this board. A bonus of this is that they are quite bit more durable and you don’t have to fiddle with the cable before plugging it in.</p>

<p>The board is packed with hardware features, here’s a short list of its most prominent ones.</p>

<p>– Sturdy USB Type C connector

<p>By Invector Labs</p> <p>The Challenger NB RP2040 WiFi is an Arduino/Micropython compatible <strong>Challenger NB</strong> (NB for No Battery) format micro controller board based on the Raspberry Pico chip. The <strong>Challenger NB</strong> form factor is based on Adafruits Feather format but we have removed the battery connector, LiPo charger and instead added a bunch of IO pins. It has retained most of the original Feather pinout so most (all) existing feather wings should work nicely with this board as well.</p>

<p>Just like the Challenger RP2040 WiFi it has a ESP8285 WiFi chip. For those of you that is unfamiliar with this device, it is basically an ESP8266 device with an integrated 1MByte of flash memory. This allows us to have an AT command interpreter inside this chip that the main controller can talk to and connect to you local WiFi network. The communications channel between the two devices is an unused UART on the main controller and the standard UART on the ESP8285. As simple as it can be.</p>

<p>The ESP8285 chip comes pre-flashed with Espressif’s AT command interpreter stored in the internal 1MByte of the ESP8285. This interpreter support most of the operating and sleep modes of the standard ESP8266 framework which makes it easy to work with. Talking to the device is as easy as opening the second serial port (Serial2), resetting the ESP8285 and start listening for events and sending commands.</p>

<p>By Invector Labs</p> <p>The iLabs Challenger RP2040 LoRa is a small embedded computer equipped with a LoRa modem module on board, in the popular <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/?q=feather">Adafruit Feather form factor</a>. It is based on an RP2040 microcontroller from Raspberry Pi which is a dual-core Cortex M0 that can run on a clock up to 133MHz.</p>

<p>This is a spin-off from our <a href="/board/challenger_rp2040_wifi/">Challenger RP2040 WiFi </a> board but we have replaced the WiFi module with a low power RFM95W LoRa radio module from Hope RF. The transceiver features a LoRa long range modem that provides ultra-long range spread spectrum communication and high interference immunity whilst minimizing current consumption.</p>

<p>The RFM95W is connected to the microcontroller using an SPI channel and a few GPIO signals to handle signalling from the modem circuit. Besides the modem module, there is only one additional U.FL connector that forms the modem functionality. Simply hook your external antenna to this connector and you are ready to go.</p>

<p>We paired the RP2040 with 8MByte high-speed flash capable of supplying data up to the max speed. The flash memory can be used both to store instructions for the microcontroller as well as data in a file system and having a file system available makes it easy to store data in a structured and easy to program approach.</p>

<p>The device can be powered by a Lithium Polymer battery connected through a standard 2.0mm connector on the side of the board. An internal battery charging circuit allows you to charge your battery safely and quickly. The device is shipped with a programming resistor that sets the charging current to ~450mA. this resistor can be exchanged by the user to either increase or decrease the charging current, depending on the battery that is being used.</p>

<p>RP2040 is the debut micro controller from Raspberry Pi. It brings their signature values of high performance, low cost, and ease of use to the micro controller space. With a large on-chip memory, symmetric dual-core processor complex, deterministic bus fabric, and rich peripheral set augmented with our unique Programmable I/O (PIO) subsystem, RP2040 provides professional users with unrivaled power and flexibility. With detailed documentation, a polished Circuitpython port, and a UF2 boot loader in ROM, it has the lowest possible barrier to entry for beginner and hobbyist users</p>

<p>The Challenger RP2040 WiFi/BLE board is equipped with a powerful combined single chip solution that provides the WiFi and BLE connectivity of this board. The chip we are using is the ESP32-C3FN4 from Espressif and it is a complete WiFi subsystem that complies with IEEE 802.11b/g/n protocol and supports Station mode, SoftAP mode, SoftAP + Station mode, and promiscuous mode. It also implements A Bluetooth LE subsystem that supports features of Bluetooth 5 and Bluetooth mesh.</p>

<p>This solution is based on an RISC-V micro controller core and comes with 4MByte of internal flash and 408Kbyte of internal SRAM as well as the advanced 2.4GHz radio.</p>

<p>The ESP32-C3 device comes pre loaded with the ESP-AT interpreter already programmed into flash. This interpreter provides the system with everything from low level TCP/UDP functionality up to high level functions such as a on board integrated web server, MQTT server and client functions and much more.</p>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p><strong>Crickit</strong> is a <strong>C</strong>reative <strong>R</strong>obotics &amp; <strong>I</strong>nteractive <strong>C</strong>onstruction <strong>Kit</strong>. It’s an add-on for the popular Circuit Playground Express that lets you <strong>#MakeRobotFriend</strong> using CircuitPython (and more).</p>

<p>Bolt on a Circuit Playground using the included stand-off bolts and start controlling motors, servos, solenoids. With CRICKIT you also get signal pins, capacitive touch sensors, a NeoPixel driver and amplified speaker output. It complements &amp; extends the Circuit Playground so you can still use all the goodies on the CPX, but now you have a robotics playground as well.</p>

<p>The Crickit is powered by seesaw, a I2C-to-whatever bridge firmware. So you only need to use two data pins to control the huge number of inputs and outputs on the Crickit. All those timers, PWMs, sensors are offloaded to the co-processor.</p>

<h2 id="technical-details">Technical details</h2>

<ul>
  <li>4x Analog or Digital Servo control, with precision 16-bit timers</li>
  <li>2x Bi-directional brushed DC motor control, 1 A current limited each, with 8-bit PWM speed control (or one stepper)</li>
  <li>4x High current “Darlington” 500mA drive outputs with kick-back diode protection. For solenoids, relays, large LEDs, or one uni-polar stepper</li>
  <li>4x Capacitive touch sensors with alligator-pads</li>
  <li>8x Signal pins, digital in/out or analog inputs</li>
  <li>1x NeoPixel driver with 5 V level shifter</li>
  <li>1x Class D, 4-8 ohm speaker, 3 W-max audio amplifier</li>
</ul>

<p>All are powered via 5 V DC, so you can use any 5V-powered servos, DC motors, steppers, solenoids, relays etc. To keep things simple and safe, CRIKIT does not support mixing voltages, use only 5 V - not for use with 9 V or 12 V robotic components.</p>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>Extend and expand your Circuit Playground projects with a bolt on TFT Gizmo that lets you add a lovely color display in a sturdy and reliable fashion. This PCB looks just like a round TFT breakout but has permanently affixed M3 standoffs that act as mechanical and electrical connections.</p>

<p>Once attached you’ll get a 1.54” 240x240 IPS display with backlight control, two 3-pin STEMMA connectors for attaching NeoPixel strips or servos, and a Class D audio amplifier with a Molex PicoBlade connector that can plug one of our lil speakers.</p>

<p>This is a great companion for our Circuit Playground Express or Bluefruit boards thanks to their fast SPI hardware speeds, and works in Arduino and CircuitPython. You can use it with the Circuit Playground Classic but it won’t be very fast, as you have to bitbang the SPI - and the display has a lot of pixels - so it’s not recommended.</p>

<p>Comes with a PCB that has pre-soldered standoffs attached, and 12x M3 screws for attachment. Fits all Circuit Playgrounds but like we mentioned earlier, the Express and Bluefruit are recommended.</p>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>We wanted to build some projects that have a small screen and a lot of sensors. This board has a 1.3″ 240×240 IPS TFT display, two buttons, and sensors.</p>

<p>Available sensors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>LSM series 9-DoF motion - LSM6DS33 Accel/Gyro + LIS3MDL magnetometer</li>
  <li>APDS9960 Proximity, Light, RGB, and Gesture Sensor</li>
  <li>PDM Microphone sound sensor</li>
  <li>Humidity, temperature and barometric environmental sensing</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s a Qwiic/STEMMA QT connector for adding more sensors, like PM2.5 air quality and others that were too big to fit on the board.</p>

<p>We’ll be primarily using CircuitPython for programming it, but it will also work in Arduino.</p>

<p>After designing it, the board was close enough to micro:bit-shape-size that we moved a few parts to make it fit in micro:bit robots and some projects – the nrf52840 is a big upgrade chip and can do stuff like Tensorflow Lite for Microcontrollers, BLE central and peripheral, and more.</p>

<h2 id="technical-details">Technical details</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Nordic nRF52840 Bluetooth LE processor - 1 MB of Flash, 256 KB RAM, 64 MHz Cortex M4 processor</li>
  <li>1.3″ 240x240 Color IPS TFT display for high resolution text and graphics</li>
  <li>Power it from any 3-6V battery source (internal regulator and protection diodes)</li>
  <li>Two A/B user buttons and one reset button</li>
  <li>RGB NeoPixel indicator LED</li>
  <li>2 MB internal flash storage for datalogging, images, fonts or CircuitPython code</li>
  <li>Buzzer/speaker for playing tones and beeps</li>
  <li>Two bright white LEDs in front for illumination/color sensing.</li>

<p>By Cytron Technologies</p> <p>The Maker Nano RP2040 is a small but powerful MCU for your project. Same Arduino Nano form factor, but powered by a RP2040 MCU. This also means that it’s compatible with some of the daughter boards for Arduino Nano in the market. Not to forget it’s also breadboard friendly to allow building your own circuit.</p>

<p>The board has a lot of LEDs. Those LEDs are not just for a nice visual effect, they also represent the status of each pins. There are also two RGB LEDs (WS2812 Neopixel) to make your life more colorful. The onboard piezo buzzer and the sliding switch are additional hardware items which are present.</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi RP2040 MCU can be programmed with C/C++ (natively or with Arduino IDE support), MicroPython or CircuitPython.</p>

<p>The I/O voltage is only 3.3 V and it’s not 5 V compatible.</p>

<p>By Cytron Technologies</p> <p>Cytron Maker Pi RP2040 features the RP2040 chip, embedded on a robot controller board. The board also comes with 2-channel DC motor driver, 4 servo motor ports and 7 Grove I/O connectors, ready for your next DIY robot/motion control projects.</p>

<p>The DC motor driver onboard is able to control two brushed DC motors or single bipolar/unipolar stepper motor from 3.6 V to 6 V, providing up to 1 A current per channel continuously. The built-in Quick Test buttons and motor output LEDs allow functional test of the motor driver in a quick and convenient way without the need of writing any test code. Vmotor for both DC and servo motors depends on the input voltage supplied to the board.</p>

<p>Maker Pi RP2040 has lots of LEDs for troubleshooting and visual effects, is able to make quite some noise with the onboard piezo buzzer and comes with push buttons ready to detect your touch.</p>

<p>There are three ways to supply power to the Maker Pi RP2040 - via USB (5 V) socket, with a single cell LiPo/Li-Ion battery or through the VIN (3.6-6 V) terminals. However only one power source is needed to power up both controller board and motors at a time. Power supply from all these power sources can all be controlled with the power on/off switch onboard.</p>

<p>CircuitPython is preloaded on the Maker Pi RP2040 and it runs a simple demo program right out-of-the-box. It can also be programmed with C/C++ (natively or with Arduino IDE support) or MicroPython.</p>

<p>By Diodes Delight</p> <p>Piunora is a compact, easy-to-use development board for electronics prototyping with Linux. It has a familiar form factor, legible pin labels, and a design that’s well suited to space-constrained applications.</p>

<p>As a carrier board for the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/compute-module-4/?variant=raspberry-pi-cm4001000">Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4</a> (CM4), Piunora is essentially a tiny version of the Raspberry Pi 4 Single Board Computer (SBC) with added flexibility to accommodate custom form factors. CM4-based devices like Piunora are fully compatible with software that was written for the Raspberry Pi 4, as long as that software accounts for the hardware peripherals in use. There are also versions of the CM4 that include eMMC memory, which is more reliable than a traditional SD card.</p>

<p>It may be small, but Piunora is packed with powerful peripherals that will come in handy for rapid prototyping and embedded machine-learning applications. Examples include an HDMI port, camera-input connectors, and PCI-e support, which is not present on a standard Raspberry Pi 4. Finally, the M.2 B-Key port on the rear of the board is not only useful for SSD storage, it can also host a diverse range of PCI-e expansion boards.</p>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>Machine learning has come to the ‘edge’ - small microcontrollers that can run a very miniature version of TensorFlow Lite to do ML computations.</p>

<p>But you don’t need super complex hardware to start developing your own TensorFlow models! We’ve adapted our popular PyBadge board to add a microphone so you can dip your toes into machine learning waters. It does everything that the PyBadge does, and as we make more projects that use Machine Learning we’ll adapt this board to make it better and better for machine learning.</p>

<p>The EdgeBadge is a compact board - it’s credit card sized. It’s powered by our favorite chip, the ATSAMD51, with 512KB of flash and 192KB of RAM. We add 2 MB of QSPI flash for file storage, handy for TensorFlow Lite files, images, fonts, sounds, or other assets.</p>

<p>We’ve added a PDM microphone on the front as an input for micro speech recognition. Our Arduino library has some demos you can get started with to recognize various word pairs like “yes/no”, “up/down” and “cat/dog”. <strong>TensorFlow Lite for microcontrollers is very cutting-edge so expect to see a lot of development happening in this area, with lots of code and process changes.</strong></p>

<p>You can code the EdgeBadge with: <a href="https://circuitpython.org/">CircuitPython</a>, <a href="https://arcade.makecode.com/hardware">MakeCode Arcade</a>, <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers">TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers / Arduino</a>, and more!</p>

<p>By Electronic Cats</p> <p>The Bast WiFi includes the newer ESP32-S2 module, which is like a little brother to the ESP32 where only one core instead of 2 has cores, it has no BLE implemented, but gains a native USB, a new processor and crypto accelerators for better performance protection against physical fault injection attacks and more improvements over the SoC.</p>

<p>Please note that the ESP32-S2 is still intended for developers. Not all peripherals are fully documented with sample code on Arduino and there are still some bugs that can be found that have yet to be fixed. We know that it is not entirely pleasant but we hope you understand us.</p>

<p>Some elements are still in development; For this reason, we recommend this board to manufacturers who have some experience in microcontroller programming, and not as a first development board.</p>

<p>By Espressif</p> <p>Ever wanted to dabble in face and/or speech recognition? <a href="https://www.espressif.com/">Espressif’s</a> <strong>ESP-EYE</strong> is a miniature <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/?q=ESP32">ESP32-based</a> development board that combines a digital microphone, ESP32 (of course) with 8 MB PSRAM and 4 MB flash, and a 2 megapixel camera. There’s a few buttons and LEDs as well for basic control and configuration.</p>

<p>Unlike some boards, this codebase does not require internet connectivity - you don’t have to send video or audio data to ‘the cloud’ - it’s all processed on-chip! The built in demo shows off what it can do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Plug into a computer USB port and open up a serial port connection at 115,200 baud to the new serial port</li>
  <li>Once the red LED is lit, activate the board with the watchword “Hi Lehshin” (in documents they spell it lexin, the x is pronounced as a shh sound)</li>
  <li>The red LED will blink - then connect to the new Wi-Fi access point created</li>
  <li>Open up a web browser to http://192.168.4.1/face_stream</li>
  <li>Point the camera at faces to show off the recognition boxes! Video is about 2 frames per second, not super fast.</li>

<p>By Espressif</p> <p>The ESP32-C3-DevKitC-02 is an entry-level <strong>RISC V</strong> development board equipped with the ESP32-C3-WROOM-02, a powerful, generic Wi-Fi + Bluetooth LE MCU module that features a rich set of peripherals, yet an optimized size. It’s an ideal choice for a wide variety of application scenarios related to the Internet of Things (IoT), such as embedded systems, smart homes, wearable electronics, etc. ESP32-C3-DevKitC-02 comes with a PCB antenna. <strong>This version is equipped with the ESP32-C3-WROOM-02 with 4MB SPI Flash and no PSRAM.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> The C<strong>3</strong> is <em>similar</em> to the ESP32 - but uses <strong>RISC V</strong> as a core, not Tensilica, and has Bluetooth LE (not classic!) However, there is minimal support for this dev board. For example, as of the time of this writing, there is no CircuitPython support - only Arduino and ESP IDF! Please purchase if you’re doing development with the C3, and recognize that it’s a different core than the classic ESP32s most folks have used.</p>

<p>Most of the I/O pins on the module are broken out to the pin headers on both sides of this board for easy interfacing. Developers can either connect peripherals with jumper wires or mount ESP32-C3-DevKitC-02 on a breadboard.</p>

<p>At the core of the module is ESP32-C3, which has a 32-bit RISC-V single-core processor. The ESP32-C3 integrates a rich set of peripherals, ranging from UART, I2C, I2S, remote control peripheral, LED PWM controller, general DMA controller, TWAI controller, USB Serial/JTAG controller, temperature sensor, and ADC. It also includes SPI, Dual SPI, and Quad SPI interfaces.</p>

<p>There are three mutually exclusive ways to provide power to the board:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Micro-USB Port, default power supply</li>
  <li>5V and GND pin headers</li>
  <li>3V3 and GND pin headers</li>
</ul>

<p>It is recommended to use the first option: Micro-USB Port.</p>

<p><strong>Components:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ESP32-C3-WROOM-02</strong>: ESP32-C3-WROOM-02 from Espressif is a powerful and general-purpose RISC V module that offers Wi-Fi and Bluetooth LE coexistence. It has a PCB antenna and 4 MB SPI flash.</li>
  <li><strong>5V to 3.3V LDO</strong>: Power regulator that converts a 5V supply into a 3.3V output.</li>
  <li><strong>5V Power On LED</strong>: Turns on when the USB power is connected to the board.</li>
  <li><strong>Pin Headers</strong>: All available GPIO pins (except for the SPI bus for flash) are broken out to the pin headers on the board for easy interfacing and programming. For details, please see <a href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s3/hw-reference/esp32s3/user-guide-devkitc-1.html#user-guide-s3-devkitc-1-v1-header-blocks">Header Block</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Micro-USB Port</strong>: USB interface. Power supply for the board as well as the communication interface between a computer and the ESP32-C3 chip.</li>
  <li><strong>Boot Button</strong>: Download button. Holding down <strong>Boot</strong> and then pressing <strong>Reset</strong> initiates Firmware Download mode for downloading firmware through the serial port.</li>
  <li><strong>Reset Button:</strong> Press this button to restart the system.</li>
  <li><strong>USB-to-UART Bridge:</strong> Single USB-to-UART bridge chip provides transfer rates up to 3 Mbps.</li>
  <li><strong>RGB LED</strong>: Addressable RGB LED, driven by GPIO8.</li>

<p>By Espressif</p> <p>The ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 is an entry-level development board equipped with ESP32-S3-WROOM-1, a general-purpose Wi-Fi + Bluetooth LE MCU module that integrates complete Wi-Fi and Bluetooth LE functions. <strong>This version is equipped with the ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 (PCB antenna) with 8MB Flash and no PSRAM.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> The S<strong>3</strong> is <em>similar</em> to the ESP32-S<strong>2</strong> - but adds a dual core and Bluetooth LE (not classic!) However, there is minimal support for this dev board. For example, as of the time of this writing, there is no Arduino or CircuitPython support - only ESP IDF! Please purchase if you’re doing development with the S3, and OK with stuff not working 100% out of the box.</p>

<p>Most of the I/O pins on the module are broken out to the pin headers on both sides of this board for easy interfacing. Developers can either connect peripherals with jumper wires or mount ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 on a breadboard. We particularly like that there’s a debug UART/USB port and a separate native USB port, so you can upload/debug/USB all at once.</p>

<p>At the core of the module is an ESP32-S3FN8, an Xtensa® 32-bit LX7 CPU that operates at up to 240 MHz. You can power off the CPU and make use of the low-power co-processor to constantly monitor the peripherals for changes or crossing of thresholds.</p>

<p>ESP32-S3FN8 integrates a rich set of peripherals including SPI, LCD, Camera interface, UART, I2C, I2S, remote control, pulse counter, LED PWM, USB Serial/Jtag, MCPWM, SDIO host, GDMA, TWAI® controller (compatible with ISO 11898-1, i.e. CAN Specification 2.0), ADC, touch sensor, temperature sensor, timers, and watchdogs, as well as up to 45 GPIOs. It also includes a full-speed USB 1.1 On-The-Go (OTG) interface to enable USB communication</p>

<p>There are three mutually exclusive ways to provide power to the board:</p>

<ul>
  <li>USB-to-UART Port and ESP32-S3 USB Port (either one or both), default power supply (recommended)</li>
  <li>5V and G (GND) pins</li>
  <li>3v3 and G (GND) pins</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Components:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ESP32-S3-WROOM-1</strong>: ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 is a powerful, generic Wi-Fi + Bluetooth LE MCU module that has a rich set of peripherals. It provides acceleration for neural network computing and signal processing workloads. ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 comes with a PCB antenna.</li>

<p>By Espressif</p> <p><strong>ESP32-S2 Saola-1</strong> is a small-sized ESP32-S2 based development board produced by Espressif. Just about all of the I/O pins are broken out to the pin headers on both sides for easy interfacing. Developers can either connect peripherals with jumper wires or mount ESP32-S2 Saola-1 on a breadboard - we recommend two breadboards ‘side-by-side’ since the Saola is a bit wide and you won’t have extra holes on one side for wiring.</p>

<p>This particular Saola comes with a WROVER module, which has 2 MB (8 Mbit) PSRAM mounted for a roomy development environment!</p>

<p>By Espruino</p> <p>Control Electronics quickly and easily with a tiny USB stick that runs JavaScript - introducing the <strong>Espruino Pico</strong>! <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1887">Dig in to the JavaScript of things, with a mini version of the popular Espruino board we already carry</a></p>

<p>This little board has an STM32 microcontroller pre-programmed with Espruino all ready to go so you can start playing immediately. <strong>Warning: if you only use Assembly and think that even embedded C/C++ is for wimps, this device might explody your head.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Essential Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>22 GPIO pins: 9 analog inputs, 21 PWM, 2 serial, 3 SPI, 3 I2C</li>
  <li>All GPIO is 3.3V but 5 volt tolerant</li>
  <li>2 rows of 9 0.1” pins, with a third 0.05” row of 8 pins on the end</li>
  <li>On-board USB “PCB Type” connector, plugs right into any computer USB port</li>
  <li>Two on-board LEDs and one button</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.espruino.com/datasheets/STM32F401xD.pdf">STM32F401CDU6</a> CPU - ARM Cortex</li>
  <li>On-board 3.3v 250mA voltage regulator, accepts voltages from 3.5v to 16v</li>
  <li>Current draw in sleep: &lt; 0.05mA - over 2.5 years on a 2500mAh battery</li>
  <li>On-board FET can be used to drive high-current outputs</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: As of Friday, October 2nd, 2015 we are selling the updated Pico with both a more helpful silkscreen marking for power, an updated USB power diode, and a 500mA polyfuse added!</p>

<p>The Espruino Pico is a USB stick with a tiny computer and JavaScript interpreter built in, allowing for instant feedback from whatever device you’re working with. Simply set up your code with the Espruino and send it to the device without having to wait for the board to ‘flash.’</p>

<p>The Pico is also designed to be easy to include in your own designs and builds. The .01” pins are easy to fit in to sockets, and castellated edges mean that unpinned Picos can easily be surface-mounted directly to a PCB. And to make it even easier, <a href="https://github.com/espruino/EspruinoBoard/tree/master/Pico/Component">Espruino provided a part library for Eagle CAD that includes the Pico’s footprint in several different configurations</a>.</p>

<p>The Espruino Pico’s fast response time has a lot of advantages. It allows for quick and easy debugging and is a great way to test your project before your big reveal. In addition, you can control the Espruino from almost anything - Windows, Mac OS, Linux, RasPi, Android, anything that can talk to a USB Serial port.</p>

See <a href="http://www.espruino.com/Quick+Start">how to get started here</a>, or if you have any questions ask away <a href="http://forum.espruino.com/">on the Espruino forums</a>!</p>

<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>30mm x 23mm (1.2 x 0.9 inch)</li>
  <li>On-board Micro USB connector</li>
  <li>2 rows of 11 0.1” pins, with 2 extra 0.1” holes</li>
  <li>21 GPIO pins : 8 Analog inputs, 20 PWM, 1 Serial, 3 SPI, 3 I2C</li>
  <li>Three on-board LEDs (2x user programmable, 1x WiFi activity) and one button.</li>
  <li>STM32F411CEU6 32-bit 100MHz ARM Cortex M4 CPU, 512kb flash, 128kb RAM</li>
  <li>ESP8266 WiFi (802.11 b/g/n)</li>
  <li>All GPIO is 5 volt tolerant (Arduino compatible)</li>
  <li>RTC with external oscillator</li>
  <li>On-board 3.3v 250mA voltage regulator, accepts voltages from 3.5v to 5v</li>
  <li>Current draw in sleep: &lt; 0.05mA - over 2.5 years on a 2500mAh battery</li>
  <li>500mA polyfuse on board</li>
</ul>

<p>The Espruino’s fast response time has a lot of advantages. It allows for quick and easy debugging and is a great way to test your project before your big reveal. In addition, you can control the Espruino from almost anything - Windows, Mac OS, Linux, RasPi, Android, anything that can talk to a USB Serial port.</p>

<p>The Espruino also interacts well with our <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/category/168">NeoPixels</a>. For more info, check out <a href="http://www.espruino.com/WS2811">Espruino’s page on the WS2811 and WS2812</a>.</p>

<p>While the main advantage of the Espruino is its instant execution, it can also be used as a traditional board through a Web-based IDE hosted on your computer. The microcontroller also uses less power than Linux Boards (although its of course a lot less powerful as well) so will run longer on battery power, it has loads of IO pins, and it can be used as an IO board for PCs, Macs, or Rasp Pis without having to program it first. Simply take the Espruino out of its packaging and get started!</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The Wifi of this board is based on ESP8266 and might not work with CircuitPython. CircuitPython typically use Airlift that rely on ESP32 with better support for TLS such as this <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4201">breakout board</a>.</p>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>The <strong>Adafruit Feather Bluefruit Sense</strong> takes our popular <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4062">Feather nRF52840 Express</a> and adds a smorgasbord of sensors to make a great wireless sensor platform. This Feather microcontroller comes with Bluetooth Low Energy and native USB support featuring the nRF52840!  This Feather is an ‘all-in-one’ Arduino-compatible + Bluetooth Low Energy with built in USB plus battery charging. With native USB it works great with CircuitPython, too.</p>

<p>Like the Feather nRF52840, <strong>this chip comes with Arduino IDE support</strong> - you can program the nRF52840 chip directly to take full advantage of the Cortex-M4 processor, and then calling into the Nordic SoftDevice radio stack when you need to communicate over BLE. Since the underlying API and peripherals are the same for the ‘832 and ‘840, you can supercharge your older nRF52832 projects with the same exact code, with a single recompile!</p>

<p>This Feather is also a <strong>BLE-friendly CircuitPython board</strong>! CircuitPython works best with disk drive access, and this is the only BLE-plus-USB-native chip that has the memory to handle running a little Python interpreter. The massive RAM and speedy Cortex M4F chip make this a good match. Make centrals or peripherals with the ease of CircuitPython.</p>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>Feather is a development board from Adafruit, and like its namesake it is thin, light, and lets you fly! Adafruit designed Feather to be a new open standard for portable microcontroller cores.</p>

<p>This is the <strong>Adafruit Feather M0 Adalogger</strong> - Adafruit’s take on an ‘all-in-one’ Cortex M0 datalogger (or data-reader) with built in USB and battery charging. It is an Adafruit Feather M0 with a microSD holder.  Check out the other boards in the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/feather">Feather family</a>.</p>

<p>At the Feather M0’s heart is an ATSAMD21G18 ARM Cortex M0 processor, clocked at 48 MHz and at 3.3 V logic, the same one used in the new <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/2843">Arduino Zero</a>. This chip has a whopping 256 KB of FLASH (8x more than the Atmega328 or 32u4) and 32 KB of RAM (16x as much)! This chip comes with built in USB so it has USB-to-Serial program &amp; debug capability built in with no need for an FTDI-like chip.</p>

<p>To make it easy to use for portable projects, Adafruit added a connector for 3.7 V Lithium polymer batteries and built in battery charging. You don’t need a battery, it will run just fine straight from the micro USB connector. But, if you do have a battery, you can take it on the go, then plug in the USB to recharge. The Feather will automatically switch over to USB power when its available. The battery is tied thru a divider to an analog pin, so you can measure and monitor the battery voltage to detect when you need a recharge.</p>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>The Adafruit Feather M0 Express was one of the first development boards designed for CircuitPython by Adafruit. Unlike the original Feather M0 Basic, it added a NeoPixel status LED and external 2 MB SPI Flash for storing CircuitPython code.</p>

<p>It is a great entry into the Feather ecosystem with CircuitPython. However, it is now out performed by the <a href="/board/feather_m4_express/">Feather M4 Express</a> which has a faster microcontroller with more RAM.

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p><strong>Crickit</strong> is Adafruit’s <strong>C</strong>reative <strong>R</strong>obotics &amp; <strong>I</strong>nteractive <strong>C</strong>onstruction <strong>Kit</strong>. It’s an add-on to popular Feather ecosystem boards that lets you <strong>#MakeRobotFriend </strong>using CircuitPython.</p>

<p>Plug in <em>any</em> Feather mainboard you want into the center, and you’re good to go! The Crickit is powered by seesaw, an I2C-to-whatever bridge firmware. So you only need to use two I2C data pins to control the huge number of inputs and outputs on the Crickit. All those timers, PWMs, sensors are offloaded to the co-processor.</p>

<p>The only thing that is <em>not</em> managed by seesaw is the audio output. Provided is a small jumper you can solder to connect the audio amplifier to the first analog pin. On Feather M0’s this is a true analog output (DAC) and you can play audio clips with CircuitPython. Other Feathers <em>may not have a DAC!</em> In that case, you can solder a wire to jumper the audio amp to a PWM pin.</p>

<p>You get to use all the non-I2C signal pins on your feather and get a boat-load of extra in/out pins, motor controllers, capacitive touch sensors, a NeoPixel driver and amplified speaker output. It complements &amp; extends your Feather so you can still use all the goodies, including stacking FeatherWings on top. But now you have a robotics playground as well.</p>

<h2 id="technical-details">Technical details</h2>

<ul>
  <li>4 x Analog or Digital Servo control, with precision 16-bit timers</li>
  <li>2 x Bi-directional brushed DC motor control, 1 A current limited each, with 8-bit PWM speed control (or one stepper)</li>
  <li>4 x High current “Darlington” 500 mA drive outputs with kick-back diode protection. For solenoids, relays, large LEDs, or one uni-polar stepper</li>
  <li>4 x Capacitive touch sensors with alligator-pads</li>
  <li>8 x Signal pins, digital in/out or analog inputs</li>
  <li>1 x NeoPixel driver with 5V level shifter - The NeoPixels are buffered and controlled by the seesaw chip</li>
  <li>1 x Class D, 4-8 ohm speaker, 3 W-max audio amplifier - the audio input pin is available as a solder-able pad for your configuration, you can connect it to your Feather’s DAC or PWM output as you desire.</li>
</ul>

<p>All are powered via 5V DC, so you can use any 5V-powered servos, DC motors, steppers, solenoids, relays etc. To keep things simple and safe, we don’t support mixing voltages, so only 5V, not for use with 9V or 12V robotic components.</p>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>This is the <strong>Adafruit Feather M0 RFM96 LoRa Radio (433 MHz).</strong> Also called <em>RadioFruits<strong>,</strong></em> Adafruit’s take on an microcontroller with a “<a href="https://www.lora-alliance.org/">Long Range (LoRa)</a>” packet radio transceiver with built in USB and battery charging. It is an Adafruit Feather M0 with a 433MHz radio module cooked in! Great for making wireless networks that are more flexible than Bluetooth LE and without the high power requirements of WiFi.</p>

<p>Feather is the development board platform from Adafruit, and like its namesake it is thin, light, and lets you fly! Adafruit designed Feather to be an open standard for portable microcontroller cores. Check out the other boards in the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/feather">Feather family</a>.</p>

<p><strong>There are 433 MHz and 898/915 MHz radio versions.</strong></p>

<p>At the Feather M0’s heart is an ATSAMD21G18 ARM Cortex M0 processor, clocked at 48 MHz and at 3.3 V logic, the same one used in the new <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/2843">Arduino Zero</a>. This chip has a whopping 256 K of FLASH (8x more than the Atmega328 or 32u4) and 32 K of RAM (16x as much)! This chip comes with built in USB so it has USB-to-Serial program &amp; debug capability built in with no need for an FTDI-like chip.</p>

<p>To make it easy to use for portable projects, Adafruit added a connector for 3.7 V Lithium polymer batteries and built in battery charging. You don’t need a battery, it will run just fine straight from the micro USB connector. But, if you do have a battery, you can take it on the go, then plug in the USB to recharge. The Feather will automatically switch over to USB power when its available. The battery is tied thru a divider to an analog pin, so you can measure and monitor the battery voltage to detect when you need a recharge.</p>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>One of our favorite Feathers, the Feather M4 Express, gets a glow-up here with an upgrade to the SAME51 chipset which has built-in CAN bus support! Like its SAMD51 cousin, the ATSAME51J19 comes with a 120 MHz Cortex M4 with floating point support and 512 KB Flash and 192 KB RAM. Your code will zig and zag and zoom, and with a bunch of extra peripherals for support, this will for sure be your favorite new chipset for CAN interfacing projects.</p>

<p>At the end of the board we have placed a CAN transceiver chip as well as a 5 V converter to generate 5 V power to the transceiver even when running on battery. The two CAN signal lines and ground reference signal are available on a 3-pin 3.5 mm terminal block. The chip and booster can be put to sleep for power saving. The built-in CAN can read or write packets and has support in both Arduino and CircuitPython.</p>

<p>Like the original Feather M4 Express, you’ll find a Mini NeoPixel and 2 MB SPI Flash. When used in CircuitPython, the 2 MB flash acts as storage for all your scripts, libraries and files.</p>

<p>And best of all, it’s a Feather - so you know it will work with all our FeatherWings! What a great way to quickly get up and running. It’s even pin-compatible with the original Feather M4.</p>

<p>Easy reprogramming: the Feather M4 CAN comes pre-loaded with the UF2 bootloader, which looks like a USB storage key. Simply drag firmware on to program, no special tools or drivers needed! It can be used to load up CircuitPython or Arduino IDE (it is bossa-compatible).</p>

<p>Comes fully assembled and tested, with the UF2 USB bootloader. We also toss in some headers so you can solder it in and plug into a solderless breadboard.</p>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>This feather is powered by the ATSAMD51J19 -  with its 120 MHz Cortex M4 with floating point support and 512 KB Flash and 192 KB RAM. Your code will zig and zag and zoom, and with a bunch of extra peripherals for support, this will for sure be your favorite new chipset.</p>

<p>And best of all, it’s a Feather - so you know it will work with all our FeatherWings! What a great way to quickly get up and running.</p>

<p>The most exciting part of the Feather M4 is that while you can use it with the Arduino IDE - and it’s bonkers fast when you do, we are shipping it with CircuitPython on board. When you plug it in, it will show up as a very small disk drive with main.py on it. Edit main.py with your favorite text editor to build your project using Python, the most popular programming language. No installs, IDE or compiler needed, so you can use it on any computer, even ChromeBooks or computers you can’t install software on. When you’re done, unplug the Feather and your code will go with you.</p>

<p>The Feather M4 Express uses the extra space left over to add a Mini NeoPixel, 2 MB SPI Flash storage and a little prototyping space. You can use the SPI Flash storage like a very tiny hard drive. When used in CircuitPython, the 2 MB flash acts as storage for all your scripts, libraries and files. When used in Arduino, you can read/write files to it, like a little datalogger or SD card, and then with our helper program, access the files over USB.</p>

<p>Easy reprogramming: the Feather M4 comes pre-loaded with the UF2 bootloader, which looks like a USB storage key. Simply drag firmware on to program, no special tools or drivers needed! It can be used to load up CircuitPython or Arduino IDE (it is bossa-compatible).</p>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>The <strong>Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Express</strong> is the new Feather family member with Bluetooth Low Energy and <em>native USB support</em> featuring the nRF52840!  It is Adafruit’s take on an ‘all-in-one’ Bluetooth Low Energy device with built in USB plus battery charging. With native USB it’s part of the CircuitPython party.</p>

<p>This chip has twice the flash, and four times the SRAM of its earlier sibling, the nRF52832 - 1 MB of FLASH and 256KB of SRAM. Compared to the nRF51, this board has 4-8 times more of everything.</p>

<p><strong>This is Adafruit’s first BLE-friendly CircuitPython board</strong>! CircuitPython works best with disk drive access, and this is the only BLE-plus-USB-native chip that has the memory to handle running the Python interpreter. The massive RAM and speedy Cortex M4F chip makes this a good match.</p>

<p>It’s got tons of peripherals: plenty of GPIO, analog inputs, PWM, timers, etc. Best of all, it’s got that native USB! Finally, no need for a separate USB serial chip like CP2104 or FT232.</p>

<p>Some other upgrades are an extra ‘USER’ switch that could be used to trigger OTA updates (or whatever you choose), a NeoPixel LED for status updates, 2 MB of QSPI Flash for storing CircuitPython files, and a SWD connector.</p>

<p>Comes pre-programed the chip with a UF2 bootloader, which can use either command line UART programming with nrfutil or drag-n-drop mass storage, for CircuitPython installation and also because mass-storage-drive bootloaders make updating firmware so easy. Want to program the chip directly? You can use command line tools with your favorite editor and toolchain. If you want to use an SWD programmer/debugger (for even more advanced usage), use a standard 2x5 0.05” connector.</p>

<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>ARM Cortex M4F (with HW floating point acceleration) running at 64MHz</li>
  <li>1MB flash and 256KB SRAM</li>
  <li><strong>Native Open Source USB stack</strong> - pre-programmed with UF2 bootloader</li>
  <li>Bluetooth Low Energy compatible 2.4GHz radio (Details available in the <a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Low-power-short-range-wireless/nRF52840">nRF52840</a> product specification)</li>
  <li><strong>FCC / IC / TELEC certified module</strong></li>
  <li>Up to +8dBm output power</li>
  <li>1.7v to 3.3v operation with internal linear and DC/DC voltage regulators</li>
  <li>21 GPIO, 6 x 12-bit ADC pins, up to 12 PWM outputs (3 PWM modules with 4 outputs each)</li>
  <li>Pin #3 red LED for general purpose blinking, NeoPixel for colorful feedback</li>
  <li>Power/enable pin</li>
  <li>Measures 2.0” x 0.9” x 0.28” (51mm x 23mm x 7.2mm) without headers soldered in</li>
  <li>Light as a (large?) feather - 6 grams</li>
  <li>4 mounting holes</li>
  <li>Reset button</li>
  <li>SWD connector for debugging</li>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>ST takes flight in this upcoming Feather board. The new STM32F405 Feather (video) that we designed runs CircuitPython at a blistering 168MHz – our fastest CircuitPython board ever! We put a STEMMA QT / Qwiic port on the end, so you can really easily plug and play I2C sensors.</p>

<p>This Feather has lots of goodies:</p>

<p>STM32F405 Cortex M4 with 1MB Flash, 168MHz speed
3.3V logic, but almost all pins are 5V compliant!
USB C power and data - our first USB C Feather!
LiPo connector and charger
SD socket on the bottom, connected to SDIO port
2 MB SPI Flash chip
Built in NeoPixel indicator
I2C, UART, GPIO, ADCs, DACs
Qwiic/STEMMA-QT connector for fast I2C connectivity
We use the built-in USB DFU bootloader to load firmware. It does not come with a UF2 bootloader.
With CircuitPython basics running on this board, it’s fast to get all our drivers working, then use the built in plotter in Mu to instantly get sensor data displaying within 3 minutes of unboxing.</p>

<p>You can use MicroPython, CircuitPython or Arduino IDE with this board, with some caveats. This board and chipset is new so expect rapid developments and updates!</p>

<p>CircuitPython support is under development. We have digital IO, analog in/out, I2C, SPI, PWM working so far and more on the way. For example, the SDIO SD card is not yet supported natively. DisplayIO is also not yet supported.
Arduino is supported through STM32duino. There’s no auto-reset bootloader support yet so you have to pull the BOOT0 pin high and manually reset before uploading. That said, STM32 support is really good, and we were able to run just about every sketch we tried.
MicroPython support is very solid but Adafruit does not provide MicroPython libraries for sensors!
We tested this in Arduino STM32duino with all our FeatherWings and only the RFM69/RFM9x libraries did not work (they are very platform specific). Its an extraordinarily fast Feather, and our first foray into STM32 - very exciting!</p>

<p>By Sean Cross (xobs)</p> <p>Only 13mm long, <strong>Fomu</strong> really puts the <em>micro</em> in microprocessor. Fomu is a fully open-source, programmable FPGA device that sits inside a USB Type-A port. It has four buttons, an RGB LED, and an FPGA that is compatible with a fully open source chain and capable of running a RISC-V core. Fomu comes in a custom plastic enclosure that slots perfectly into a USB port.</p>

<p>Fomu:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>has Python</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>With 128 kilobytes of RAM and a large amount of storage, Fomu is powerful enough to run Python natively. And since it lives in your USB port, installation is super simple. FPGAs are complicated, but the latest Python tools make it easy to use Fomu without any specialized training.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>runs RISC-V</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Underneath the Python interpreter lies a RISC-V softcore running on the FPGA fabric. RISC-V is an up-and-coming processor architecture that is poised to take over everything from deeply-embedded chips to high-performance computing. Fomu’s RISC-V softcore is a great introduction to the processor architecture of the future.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>is an FPGA</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>An FPGA is a piece of reconfigurable silicon. The default Fomu firmware exposes a USB bootloader running a RISC-V softcore, but you can load whatever you want. Softcores are also available for LM32 and OpenRISC. You can practice adding instructions to the CPU, or add new blocks such as LED blink patterns or better captouch hardware blocks.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>is entirely open</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Developing with Fomu is incredibly easy: just load code via USB and go. Whether you’re writing RISC-V code, Python code, or HDL, it’s all uploaded to Fomu in the same way. The ICE40UP5K FPGA is supported with a fully open toolchain, meaning you can start development without creating an account, signing an NDA, or downloading a multi-gigabyte installer.
An FPGA is an Array of Gates that is Field-Programmable. When you buy a chip such as a CPU, the logic cells are all fixed in place. A CPU can run any amount of code, but if you want to do anything exotic you need to create software and, depending on what you want to do, that software can be very slow.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For example, many embedded projects use WS2812 LEDs such as <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/?q=WS2812">NeoPixels</a> that require a specialized timing signal. A CPU can generate this signal in software, but it can’t do anything in the background while talking to the light. If the string of LEDs is very long, then the CPU wastes a lot of time and power generating the signal.</p>

<p>With an FPGA, it becomes possible to create an “LED driver” that allows the CPU to keep running while a hardware component handles the timing. The CPU could do other work, or could put itself in a low power state.</p>

<p>In fact, the “CPU” in the FPGA is created from a hardware description language, meaning it can be modified or swapped out. If you wanted, you could create a brand-new CPU instruction. Do you want to have fast 64-bit multiplies? Or maybe you want a way to get random numbers easily? With Fomu and its FPGA, you have the source code to the CPU itself.</p>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>The <strong>Adafruit Gemma M0</strong> is a super small microcontroller board, with just enough built-in to create many simple projects. It may look small and cute: round, about the size of a quarter, with friendly alligator-clip sew pads. But do not be fooled! The Gemma M0 is incredibly powerful! Adafruit used the same form factor from <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1222">the original ATtiny85-based Gemma</a> and gave it an upgrade. The Gemma M0 has swapped out the lightweight ATtiny85 for a ATSAMD21E18 powerhouse.</p>

<p>The Gemma M0 will super-charge your wearables! It’s just as small, and it’s easier to use, so you can do more.</p>

<p>The most exciting part of the Gemma M0 is that it ships with CircuitPython on board. When you plug it in, it will show up as a very small disk drive with <strong>code.py</strong> on it. Edit <strong>code.py</strong> with your favorite text editor to build your project using Python, the most popular programming language. No installs, IDE or compiler needed, so you can use it on any computer, even ChromeBooks or computers you can’t install software on. When you’re done, unplug the Gemma M0 and your code will go with you.</p>

<p>Gemma M0 features:</p>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>The <strong>Adafruit Gemma M0</strong> is a super small microcontroller board, with just enough built-in to create many simple projects. It may look small and cute: round, about the size of a quarter, with friendly alligator-clip sew pads. But do not be fooled! The Gemma M0 is incredibly powerful! Adafruit used the same form factor from <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1222">the original ATtiny85-based Gemma</a> and gave it an upgrade. The Gemma M0 has swapped out the lightweight ATtiny85 for a ATSAMD21E18 powerhouse.</p>

<p>The Gemma M0 will super-charge your wearables! It’s just as small, and it’s easier to use, so you can do more.</p>

<p>The most exciting part of the Gemma M0 is that it ships with CircuitPython on board. When you plug it in, it will show up as a very small disk drive with <strong>code.py</strong> on it. Edit <strong>code.py</strong> with your favorite text editor to build your project using Python, the most popular programming language. No installs, IDE or compiler needed, so you can use it on any computer, even ChromeBooks or computers you can’t install software on. When you’re done, unplug the Gemma M0 and your code will go with you.</p>

<p>Gemma M0 features:</p>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>The <strong>Adafruit Grand Central</strong> features the <strong>Microchip ATSAMD51</strong>. This dev board is so big, it’s not named after a Metro train, it’s a whole freakin’ <em>station</em>!</p>

<p>This board is like a freight train, with its 120MHz Cortex M4 with floating point support. Your code will zig and zag and zoom, and with a bunch of extra peripherals for support, this will for sure be your favorite new chipset.</p>

<p>The Grand Central is the first SAMD board that has enough pins to make it in the form of the Arduino Mega - with a massive number of pins, tons of analog inputs, dual DAC output, 8 MBytes of QSPI flash, SD card socket, and a NeoPixel.</p>

<p>To start off our ATSAMD51 journey, it goes large with the Mega shape and pinout you know and love. The front half has the same shape and pinout as an Adafruit Metro, so it is compatible with many shields. It’s got analog pins where you expect, and SPI/UART/I2C hardware support in the same spot as the Metro 328 and M0. But! It’s powered with an ATSAMD51P20:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cortex M4 core running at <strong>120 MHz</strong></li>
  <li><a href="https://developer.arm.com/technologies/dsp/dsp-for-cortex-m">Floating point support with Cortex M4 DSP instructions</a></li>
  <li><strong>1MB</strong> flash, <strong>256 KB</strong> RAM</li>
  <li>32-bit, 3.3V logic and power</li>
  <li><strong>70 GPIO pins in total</strong></li>
  <li>Dual 1 MSPS DAC (A0 and A1)</li>
  <li>Dual 1 MSPS ADC (15 analog pins)</li>
  <li>8 x hardware SERCOM (can be I2C, SPI or UART)</li>
  <li>22 x PWM outputs</li>
  <li>Stereo I2S input/output with MCK pin</li>
  <li>12-bit Parallel capture controller (for camera/video in)</li>
  <li>Built in crypto engines with AES (256 bit), true RNG, Pubkey controller</li>
</ul>

<p>Extras:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Power the Grand Central</strong> with 6-12V polarity protected DC or the micro USB connector to any 5V USB source. The 2.1mm DC jack has an on/off switch next to it so you can turn off your setup easily. The board will automagically switch between USB and DC.</li>
  <li><strong>Grand Central has 62 GPIO pins</strong>, 16 of which are analog in, and two of which is a true analog out. There’s a hardware SPI port, hardware I2C port and hardware UART. 5 more SERCOMs are available for extra I2C/SPI/UARTs.</li>
  <li><strong>Logic level is 3.3V</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Native USB</strong>, there’s no need for a hardware USB to Serial converter as the Metro M4 has built in USB support. When used to act like a serial device, the USB interface can be used by any computer to listen/send data to the METRO, and can also be used to launch and update code via the bootloader. It can also act like an HID keyboard or mouse.</li>
  <li><strong>Four indicator LEDs and one NeoPixel</strong>, on the front edge of the PCB, for easy debugging. One green power LED, two RX/TX LEDs for data being sent over USB, and a red LED connected. Next to the reset button there is an RGB NeoPixel that can be used for any purpose.</li>
  <li><strong>8 MB QSPI Flash </strong>storage chip is included on board. You can use the SPI Flash storage like a very tiny hard drive. When used in Circuit Python, the 8 MB flash acts as storage for all your scripts, libraries and files.</li>
  <li><strong>Micro SD Card slot</strong> - removable storage of any size, connected to an SPI SERCOM (SDIO is not supported)</li>
  <li><strong>Easy reprogramming</strong>, comes pre-loaded with the <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-metro-m0-express-designed-for-circuitpython/uf2-bootloader">UF2 bootloader</a>, which looks like a USB storage key. Simply drag firmware on to program, no special tools or drivers needed! It can be used to load up CircuitPython (it is bossa v1.8 compatible)</li>
</ul>

<p>The primary target for this board is CircuitPython - with 120 MHz, and 256KB of RAM CircuitPython runs <em>really</em> well on this chip!</p>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>This is Hallowing..this is Hallowing… Hallowing! Hallowing! </p>

<p>Are you the kind of person who doesn’t like taking down the skeletons and spiders until after January? This is development board for you. This is electronics at its <em>most spooky!</em> The <strong>Adafruit HalloWing</strong> is a skull-shaped ATSAMD21 board with a ton of extras built in to make for an adorable wearable, badge, development kit, or the engine for your next cosplay or prop.</p>

<p>On the front is a cute <strong>1.44” sized 128x128 full color TFT</strong>. There’s also 4 fang-teeth below the display, these are analog/capacitive touch inputs with big alligator-clip holes.</p>

<p>On the reverse is a smorgasbord of electronic goodies:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ATSAMD21G18</strong> @ 48MHz with 3.3V logic/power - 256KB of FLASH + 32KB of RAM</li>
  <li><strong>8 MB of SPI Flash</strong> for storing images, sounds, animations, whatever!</li>
  <li><strong>3-axis accelerometer</strong> (motion sensor)</li>
  <li><strong>Light sensor</strong>, reverse-mount so that it points out the front</li>
  <li><strong>Mono Class-D speaker driver</strong> for 4-8 ohm speakers, up to 2 Watts, with mini volume pot</li>
  <li>LiPoly battery port with built in recharging capability</li>
  <li>USB port for battery charging, programming and debugging</li>
  <li>Two female header strips with Feather-compatible pinout so you can plug any FeatherWings in</li>
  <li>JST ports for Neopixels, sensor input, and I2C (you can fit I2C Grove connectors in here)</li>
  <li>3.3V regulator with 500mA peak current output</li>
  <li>Reset button</li>
  <li>On-Off switch</li>
</ul>

<p>Right now you can use the Hallowing similarly Feather M0 Express, it’s got the same chip although the pins have been rearranged. CircuitPython support, the extra 8 MB of SPI Flash is great for sound effects projects where you want to play up to 3 minutes of WAV files.</p>

<p>On each side of the Hallowing are JST-PH plugs for connecting external devices. The 3-pin JSTs connect to analog pins on the SAMD21, so you can use them for analog inputs. One is labeled for Neopixel and one for Sensors since most people will have one of each. The 4-pin JST connector connects to the I2C port and you can fit Grove connectors in it for additional hardware support.</p>

<p>Comes fully assembled and ready to be your spooky friend. Comes installed with the UF2 bootloader.</p>

  <li>Built-in BlueTooth 5 (nRF52840) and WiFi (ESP32)</li>
  <li>2 MB of QSPI Flash storage</li>
  <li>Battery Charging and 1.5A DC-DC</li>
  <li>1.3” TFT-LCD (IPS 240x240)</li>
  <li>5x Neopixel</li>
  <li>1W Speaker with class-D amplifier</li>
  <li>1x Red LED (programmable)</li>
  <li>1x White LED (programmable)</li>
  <li>2x Button (A and B) + 1x reset button</li>
  <li>1x Sound sensor (MEMS microphone)</li>
  <li>1x Integrated Optical sensor (Proximity, Gesture, Color, and Illumination)</li>
  <li>1x Temperature and Humidity sensor (SHT31-Dis)</li>
  <li>1x Magnetometer 3-axis sensor (LIS3MDL)</li>
  <li>1x 3-axis Accelerometer and 3-axis Gyroscope (LSM6DS)</li>
  <li>1x mini-Grove/Qwiic/STEMMA QT connector</li>
</ul>

<p>The HiiBot BlueFi have a lot of sensors, vs 6-DoF motion sensor of microbit, including 9-DoF motion sensors, sound sensor, temperature &amp; humidity sensor, and integrated optical sensor. At the same time, BlueFi have two buttons, three touchpads, and 40-Pin extended interface on the microbit.</p>

<p>In a variety of IoT application scenario, BlueTooth and WiFi is an integral part of the wireless connection channel. BlueTooth and WiFi be supportted at the same time on the BlueFI board. You can realize bridges, gateways and other net equipment with BlueFi.</p>

<p>Built-in a lot of sensors and output devices on the HiiBot BlueFi, but a low-cost SBC. Our purpose is to help you quickly realize all kinds of ideas, no trouble wiring and welding electronic components.</p>

<p>The most exciting part of the HiiBot BlueFi is that while you can use it with the Arduino IDE - and it’s bonkers fast when you do, we are shipping it with CircuitPython on board. When you plug it in, it will show up as a very small disk drive with code.py on it. Edit code.py with your favorite text editor to build your project using Python, the most popular programming language. No installs, IDE or compiler needed, so you can use it on any computer, even ChromeBooks or computers you can’t install software on. When you’re done, unplug the BlueFi and your code will go with you.</p>

<p>Easy reprogramming: the HiiBot BlueFi comes pre-loaded with the UF2 bootloader, which looks like a USB storage key. Simply drag firmware on to program, no special tools or drivers needed! It can be used to load up CircuitPython or Arduino IDE.</p>

<p>By Ikigaisense</p> <p>Ideally VitaPatch could be a disposable patch. It is an dedicated device to monitor vital signs of temperature, heart rate, SpO2 and blood pressure. It is also an integrated solution to monitor all these vital signs.</p>

<p>VitaPatch has to be small if not tiny so that it is convenient. It has to be cheap so that it could be available to more people. It will be open sourced so that anyone could hack and improve.</p>

<p>This is an ambitious endeavour and most likely a bumpy one. If you are intrigued, let’s join the force to make it real.</p>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>What’s smaller than a Feather but larger than a Trinket? It’s an <strong>Adafruit ItsyBitsy nRF52840 Express</strong> featuring the <strong>Nordic nRF52840 Bluetooth LE</strong> processor! Teensy &amp; powerful, with an fast nRF52840 Cortex M4 processor running at 64 MHz and 1 MB of FLASH - this microcontroller board is perfect when you want something very compact, with a heap-load of memory and Bluetooth LE support This Itsy is your best option for tiny wireless connectivity - it can act as both a BLE central and peripheral, with support in both Arduino and CircuitPython</p>

<p>ItsyBitsy nRF52840 Express is only 1.4” long by 0.7” wide, but has 6 power pins, 21 digital GPIO pins (6 of which can be analog in). It’s the same chip as the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4062">Feather nRF52840</a> but <em>really really small</em>. So it’s great for thse really compact builds. It even comes with 2MB of QSPI Flash built in, for data logging, file storage, or CircuitPython code.</p>

<p>The most exciting part of the ItsyBitsy is that while we ship it with an Arduino IDE compatible demo, you can also install CircuitPython on board with only a few clicks. When you plug it in, it will show up as a very small disk drive with code.py on it. Edit code.py with your favorite text editor to build your wireless-enabled project using Python, the most popular programming language. No installs, IDE or compiler needed, so you can use it on any computer, even ChromeBooks or computers you can’t install software on. When you’re done, unplug the Itsy’ and your code will go with you.</p>

<p>By Max Holliday</p> <p>CircuitPython provides an approachable and logical means of conducting science with hardware. Paired with low-cost hardware shown to work in space, we can enable an new generation to question and explore the unknown. With the necessary “satellite stuff” already baked in, students can spend their time trying something new rather than reinventing the wheel (similar philosophy to early Arduino efforts and the microcontroller movement in general).</p>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>Folks love our <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/category/327">wide selection of RGB matrices</a> and accessories, for making custom colorful LED displays… and our RGB Matrix Shields and FeatherWings can be quickly soldered together to make the wiring much easier. But what if we made it even easier than that? <strong>Like, no solder, no wiring, just instant plug-and-play?</strong> Dream no more - with the <strong>Adafruit Matrix Portal add-on for RGB Matrices</strong>, there’s never been an easier way to create powerful Internet-connected LED displays.</p>

<p>Plug directly into the back of <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/category/327">any HUB-75 compatible display (all the ones we stock will work) from 16x32 up to 64x64</a>! Use the included screws to attach the power cable to the power plugs with a common screwdriver, then power it with any USB C power supply. (For larger projects, power the matrices with a separate 5V power adapter)</p>

<p>Then code up your project in <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/rgb-led-matrices-matrix-panels-with-circuitpython">CircuitPython</a> or <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-protomatter-rgb-matrix-library">Arduino</a>, our Protomatter matrix library works great on the SAMD51 chipset, knowing that you’ve got the wiring and level shifting all handled.</p>

<h3 id="features">Features</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ATSAMD51J19 Cortex M4 processor</strong>, 512 KB flash, 192 K of SRAM, with full Arduino or CircuitPython support</li>
  <li><strong>ESP32 WiFi co-processor</strong> with TLS support and SPI interface to the M4, with full Arduino or CircuitPython support</li>
  <li><strong>USB-C</strong> connector for data and power connectivity</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/category/620"><strong>I2C STEMMA QT connector</strong> for plug-n-play use of any of our STEMMA QT devices or sensors</a> can also be used with <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4528">any Grove I2C devices using this adapter cable</a>)</li>
  <li><strong>JST 3-pin connector</strong> that also has analog input/output, say for adding audio playback to projects</li>
  <li><strong>LIS3DH accelerometer</strong> for digital sand projects or detecting taps/orientation.</li>
  <li><strong>GPIO breakouts</strong> including 4 analog outputs with PWM and SPI support for adding other hardware.</li>
  <li><strong>Address E line jumper</strong> for use with 64x64 matrices (check your matrix to see which pin is used for address E!</li>
  <li><strong>Two user interface buttons</strong> + one reset button</li>
  <li><strong>Indicator NeoPixel</strong> and red LED</li>
  <li><strong>Green power indicator LEDs</strong> for both 3 V and 5 V power</li>
  <li><strong>2x10 socket connector</strong> fits snugly into 2x8 HUB75 ports without worrying about ‘off by one’ errors.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Matrix Portal uses an ATMEL (Microchip) ATSAMD51J19, and an Espressif ESP32 Wi-Fi coprocessor with TLS/SSL support built-in. The M4 and ESP32 are a great couple - and each bring their own strengths to this board. The SAMD51 M4 has native USB so it can show up like a disk drive, act as a MIDI or HID keyboard/mouse, and of course bootload and debug over a serial port. It also has DACs, ADC, PWM, and tons of GPIO, so it can handle the high speed updating of the RGB matrix.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the ESP32 has secure WiFi capabilities, and plenty of Flash and RAM to buffer sockets. By letting the ESP32 focus on the complex TLS/SSL computation and socket buffering, it frees up the SAMD51 to act as the user interface. You get a great programming experience thanks to the native USB with files available for drag-n-drop, and you don’t have to spend a ton of processor time and memory to do SSL encryption/decryption and certificate management. It’s the best of both worlds!</p>

<p>Comes with one fully-programmed and assembled MatrixPortal, preprogrammed with a rainbow digital sand demo for 32x64 LED matrices.</p>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>This <strong>Metro M0 Express</strong> board looks a whole lot like the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2488">original Metro 328</a>, but with a huge upgrade. Instead of the ATmega328, this Metro features a ATSAMD21G18 chip, an ARM Cortex M0+. It’s the first Adafruit Metro that is designed for use with CircuitPython!</p>

<p>At the Metro M0’s heart is an ATSAMD21G18 ARM Cortex M0 processor, clocked at 48 MHz and at 3.3 V logic, the same one used in the new <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/2843">Arduino Zero</a>. This chip has a whopping 256 KB of FLASH (8x more than the Atmega328) and 32 KB of RAM (16x as much)! This chip comes with built in USB so it has USB-to-Serial program &amp; debug capability built in with no need for an FTDI-like chip.</p>

<h2 id="technical-details">Technical details</h2>

<ul>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>Give your next project a lift with <em>AirLift</em> - Adafruit’s witty name for the ESP32 co-processor that graces this Metro M4.</p>

<p>You already know about the <strong>Adafruit Metro M4</strong> featuring the <strong>Microchip ATSAMD51</strong>, with it’s 120 MHz Cortex M4 with floating point support. With a train-load of FLASH and RAM, your code will be fast and roomy. And what better way to improve it than to add wireless? Now cooked in directly on board, you get a certified WiFi module that can handle all your TLS and socket needs, it even has root certificates pre-loaded.</p>

<p>This Metro is the same size as the others, and is compatible with all our shields. It’s got analog pins where you expect, and SPI/UART/I2C hardware support in the same spot as the Metro 328 and M0. But! It’s powered with an ATSAMD51J19.</p>

<h2 id="technical-details">Technical details</h2>

<ul>

<p>In order to support CircuitPython, a 2MB Quad-SPI flash memory chip is included. This provides plenty of space for the CircuitPython program as well as space for user programming.  It comes pre-loaded with the latest CircuitPython library bundle.</p>

<h2 id="power">Power</h2>
<p>The boards include a 600mA 3.3V regulator, more than enough to power this little board and its built-in features. The board can be powered from a micro-USB or via a battery connected to the BAT pin – it will automatically switch between the two.  There are exposed pads to solder on an optional 2-JST battery connector on the back or directly to the BAT pin.</p>

<h2 id="purchase">Purchase</h2>
<p>When in stock, you can purchase a board from minifigboards.com</p>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>Peep dis! Have you always wanted to have another pair of eyes on the back of your
head? Or outfit your costume with big beautiful orbs? The MONSTER M4SK is like the
Hallowing but twice as good, with two gorgeous 240x240 pixel IPS TFT displays, driven
by a 120MHZ Cortex M4 processor that can pump out those pixels super fast. You’ll get
the same quality display as our Raspberry Pi Eyes kit but without needing to tote
around a full Linux computer</p>

<p>This unique design has the eyes at the same pupil-distance as a human (~63mm) but is
designed so that the nose section can be broken apart with pliers/cutters and then
wired together with a 9-pin JST SH cable up to 100mm long so the eyes can be
re-positioned or freely attached.</p>

<p>We wanted to make audio-effects easier so in addition to a class D audio amp, there’s
also a stereo headphone jack that is connected to the two DACs on the chip. Use it
when you want an externally sound amplifier box for big effects. For small portable
effects, the built-in amp can drive 8 ohm speakers up to 1 Watt.</p>

<p>On each side are JST-PH plugs for connecting external devices. The 3-pin JSTs connect
to analog/timer pins on the SAMD51, so you can use them for sensors or GPIO
devices. The 4-pin JST connector connects to the I2C port and you can fit Grove
connectors in it for additional hardware support. For the PDM mic port, you can use
this cable to wire to a PDM mic.</p>

<p>There’s also plenty of sensors built in - light sensor, 3 tactile buttons, and a
capacitive touch pad on the nose.</p>

<p>Speaking of that nose, the silkscreen is by the skillful Miss Monster, check out those fangs!</p>

<p>This is by far the cutest, creepiest and most incredible development board we’ve made so far!
Gaze upon these features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ATSAMD51G19 Cortex M4 microcontroller running at 120MHz with 512KB Flash, 192KB RAM</li>
  <li>8 MB QSPI flash for storing graphics and sound effects</li>
  <li>Two 240x240 IPS TFT displays each on their own SPI bus</li>
  <li>Beautiful silkscreen with a boop-able nose that is a capacitive touch pad</li>
  <li>Lipoly battery charge circuit for portable use</li>
  <li>Stereo headphone jack out, for sound effects via an amplifier</li>
  <li>Mono speaker driver for smaller 8 ohm 1W speakers</li>
  <li>One 4 pin STEMMA JST connector for I2C connection (also Grove compatible)</li>
  <li>Two 3 pin STEMMA JST connectors with digital/analog/PWM for servos, sensors, etc</li>
  <li>One 4 pin JST SH port for connecting an optional PDM microphone</li>
  <li>Backlight controls</li>
  <li>Three tactile buttons</li>
  <li>Light sensor</li>
  <li>On/Off Switch and reset button</li>

<p>By Morpheans</p> <p>While there are many ESP32 dev boards on the market, we here at <a href="http://www.morpheans.com/">Morpheans</a> found ourselves lamenting the scarcity of such boards for the new ESP32-<em>S2</em>. So we decided to build one. <strong>Introducing MorphESP 240, an easy-to-use, Arduino- and CircuitPython-compatible, open hardware ESP32-S2 dev board with a built-in high-resolution, IPS-color display.</strong></p>

<p>Our target was <em>minimalism with room to grow</em>, and—after squeezing the following specs into a 20 g, 89 x 28 x 6 mm package—we believe we’ve hit the bullseye:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An ESP32-S2 WROOM with
    <ul>
      <li>A 240 MHz single-core microcontroller</li>
      <li>128 KB of ROM</li>
      <li>320 KB of SRAM</li>
      <li>802.11 b/g/n/ 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>An on-board, SPI-driven, 240 x 240 pixel ST7789 display</li>
  <li>A classic, multi-color WS2812B RGB LED</li>
  <li>A built-in, JST-connected battery with a USB charging module</li>
  <li>A 5 V to 3.3 V regulator to feed additional modules</li>
  <li>Plenty of GPIOs to play with</li>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>It’s half USB Key, half Adafruit Trinket<em>…</em>it’s <strong>Neo Trinkey</strong>, the circuit board with a Trinket M0 heart and four RGB NeoPixels for customizable glow. We were inspired by some USB key flashlight boards that would turn any battery pack into an LED torch. So we thought, hey what if we made something like that but with fully programmable color NeoPixels? And this is what we came up with!</p>

<p>The PCB is designed to slip into any USB A port on a computer or laptop. There’s an ATSAMD21 microcontroller on board with just enough circuitry to keep it happy. One pin of the microcontroller connects to the four NeoPixel LEDs. Two other pins are used as capacitive touch inputs on the end - if you look carefully you can see the slotted end has left and right touch pads. A reset button lets you enter bootloader mode if necessary. That’s it!</p>

<p>The SAMD21 can run CircuitPython or Arduino very nicely - with existing NeoPixel and our FreeTouch libraries for the capacitive touch input. Over the USB connection you can have serial, MIDI or HID connectivity. The Neo Trinkey is perfect for simple projects that can use a few user inputs and colorful outputs. Maybe you’ll set it up as a simple status notifier, or stretch-break timer, or a macro keypad, or a random color generator, or, hey you could still make it into an LED flashlight if you wanted!</p>

<p>We think its just an adorable little board, small and durable and inexpensive enough that it could be a first microcontroller board, or inspiration for advanced developers to make something simple and fun.</p>

<ul>
  <li>ATSAMD21E18 32-bit Cortex M0+ - 48 MHz 32 bit processor with 256KB Flash and 32 KB RAM</li>
  <li>Native USB supported by every OS - can be used in Arduino or CircuitPython as USB serial console, MIDI, Keyboard/Mouse HID, even a little disk drive for storing Python scripts.</li>
  <li>Can be used with Arduino IDE or CircuitPython</li>
  <li>Four RGB NeoPixel LEDs</li>
  <li>Two Capacitive Touch pads</li>
  <li>Reset switch for starting your project code over or entering bootloader mode</li>
  <li>Slim and cute, keychain-friendly!</li>

<p>By Electronic Cats</p> <p>NFC Copy Cat, manufactured by Electronic Cats, is a small device that combines two powerful cybersecurity tools, NFCopy and MagSpoof. NFCopy works by reading or emulating a NFC card; depending on the necessities of the researcher. On the other hand, MagSpoof can wirelessly emulate/spoof any magnetic stripe card. So using NFC Copy Cat, the user will have a device capable of storing magnetic stripe data or NFC payment data to be replayed later — known in the cybersecurity world as a replay attack.</p>

<p>By Radomir Dopieralski</p> <p>This board was designed to be an affordable device for teaching game
development. An eight by eight display, with four shades of pixels, together
with an equivalent of a Trinket M0 on board let you create and play simple
games such as Snake, Tetris or Frogger. A number of example games, together
with an online tutorial and documentation, let you quickly pick up the skills
that you will later find useful when creating bigger games and interactive
applications. A row of pins on the back also lets you connect anything you
could use with other boards, so you can also use this for playing with
electronics.</p>

into USB and you can modify the example games or write your own.</p>

<h2 id="updating-warning">Updating Warning</h2>

<p>If you update this board from version 5.x or older to version 6.x or newer, you
have to replace the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.py</code> file with a <a href="https://github.com/pewpew-game/game-m4-menu">newer version obtained from the
repository</a>, otherwise the game
selection menu will not work with the new version of CircuitPython.</p>

<h2 id="about-rp2040">About RP2040</h2>

<p>Raspberry Pi’s RP2040 microcontroller is a dual core ARM Cortex M0+ running at up to 133Mhz. It bundles in 264kB of SRAM, 30 multifunction GPIO pins (including a four channel 12-bit ADC), a heap of standard peripherals (I2C, SPI, UART, PWM, clocks, etc), and USB support.</p>

<p>One very exciting feature of RP2040 is the programmable IOs which allow you to execute custom programs that can manipulate GPIO pins and transfer data between peripherals - they can offload tasks that require high data transfer rates or precise timing that traditionally would have required a lot of heavy lifting from the CPU.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-rp2040">About the RP2040</h2>
<p>The RP2040 microcontroller is a dual core ARM Cortex M0+ running at up to 133Mhz. It bundles in 264kB of SRAM, 30 multifunction GPIO pins (including a four channel 12-bit ADC), a heap of standard peripherals (I2C, SPI, UART, PWM, clocks, etc), and USB support.</p>

<p>One very exciting feature of the RP2040 microcontroller are the programmable IOs which allow you to execute custom programs that can manipulate GPIO pins and transfer data between peripherals - they can offload tasks that require high data transfer rates or precise timing that traditionally would have required a lot of heavy lifting from the CPU.</p>

<p>By Pimoroni</p> <p>A compact 4 channel motor+encoder controller, powered by RP2040. It has RGB and per-motor indicator LEDs plus built in voltage and current sensing. There’s also a Qwiic/STEMMA QT connector for adding breakouts!</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Powered by RP2040 (Dual Arm Cortex M0+ running at up to 133Mhz with 264kB of SRAM)</li>
  <li>2MB of QSPI flash supporting XiP</li>
  <li>2 Dual H-Bridge motor drivers (DRV8833)</li>
  <li>4 JST-SH connectors (6 pin) for attaching motors</li>
  <li>Wide voltage range for motors and logic (2.7V to 10V)</li>
  <li>On-board 3V3 regulator with input up to 13.2V (max regulator current output 150mA)</li>
  <li>Onboard voltage, current and fault sensing</li>
  <li>Per motor current limiting (0.5A) *</li>
  <li>Per motor direction indicator LEDs **</li>
  <li>Addressable RGB LED/Neopixel</li>
  <li>Reset and BOOT button (the BOOT button can also be used as a user button)</li>
  <li>USB-C connector for programming and power (3A max)</li>
  <li>Qw/ST (Qwiic/STEMMA QT) connector for breakouts</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="powering-motor-2040">Powering Motor 2040</h2>
<p>Motor 2040 can be powered either by plugging the board into a USB-C power source (like a PC or power adapter) or by connecting a battery pack to the EXT PWR or VSYS connections. On an unmodified board, <strong>you should only have one power source connected at a time</strong>, to avoid back-powering your computer or battery.</p>

<p>If you want to have two power sources connected at the same time, Motor 2040 has two traces on its underside that you can cut to do this safely.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cut EXT PWR to VSYS</strong> if you want to provide your motors with a separate power supply (up to 10V) from that used to power the rest of the board. Board power (up to 13.2V) will need to be provided either by USB 5V or VSYS.</li>
  <li><strong>Cut USB 5V to VSYS</strong> if you want to run the board entirely off a separate power supply, without worry of back-powering your computer. Note that this also means the board will not turn on when only connected by USB.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>* The current limit of each motor can be disabled by soldering the “high current” pads on the rear (doing this will also disable the current monitoring). The maximum supported output current is 1.2 A continuous (2 A peak) per motor.</li>
  <li>** The direction indicators for each motor can be disabled by cutting the “motor LED” traces on the rear.</li>
  <li>The pinout of the JST-SH motor connectors is M+, M-, 3v3, A, B, GND.</li>
</ul>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>The pIRkey adds an IR remote receiver to any computer, laptop, tablet…any computer or device with a USB port that can use a keyboard. This little board slides into any USB A port, and shows up as an every-day USB keyboard. The onboard ATSAMD21 microcontroller listens for IR remote signals and converts them to keypresses, mouse movements, or even USB serial output.</p>

<p>Infrared is a favorite wireless protocol - no antennas, certifications, pairings, passwords, or special tools required. Works everywhere in the world and very intuitive - everyone’s got an IR remote in their home.</p>

<p>The <strong>pIRkey</strong> is an improvement on Adafruit’s original IRkey product, by adding a <strong>p</strong> for <strong>python</strong>. Now with CircuitPython being available for the tiny ATSAMD21E processor, it’s swapped in for the ATtiny85, giving a huge boost in power and a working Python interpreter on board as well. This means it is easy to reprogram, customize or adapt it to whatever Infrared-reading needs you may have.</p>

<p>When you plug it in, the pIRkey shows up as a triple device: USB disk drive to store code, USB serial for debugging and Python interactive command line, and USB keyboard/mouse that can transmit keypresses or mouse movements.</p>

<p>By default it ships with simple example code to read NEC remotes but <strong>you can use <em>any</em> remote that has about 38KHz output frequency which is the vast majority of remote controls</strong>. CircuitPython makes this all very easy to customize and adapt to your own needs.</p>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>The Adafruit PyBadge an all-in-one compact dev board programmable in CircuitPython. Full of features squeezed onto a 3 3⁄8 × 2 1⁄8 inch rounded credit card sized rectangle. It’s a perfect wearable badge, but can be used for many projects.</p>

<p>The PyBadge is powered by our favorite microcontroller, the ATSAMD51, with 512KB of flash and 192KB of RAM. There is an additional 2 MB of QSPI flash for file storage, handy for images, fonts, sounds, or game assets.</p>

<p>On the front, there is a 1.8” 160x128 color TFT display with dimmable backlight. There is fast DMA support for drawing, so updates are incredibly fast. There are also 8 silicone-top buttons: they are clicky but have a soft button top so they’re nice and grippy. The buttons are arranged to mimic a gaming handheld, with a d-pad, 2 menu-select buttons and 2 fire-action buttons. There are also 5 NeoPixel LEDs to dazzle or track activity.</p>

<p>On the back, there is a full Feather-compatible header socket set, so you can plug in any FeatherWing to expand the capabilities of the PyBadge. There are also 3 STEMMA connectors - two 3-pin with ADC/PWM capability and one 4-pin that connects to I2C - you can use this for Grove sensors as well.</p>

<p>For built-in sensors, there is a light sensor that points out the front, and a 3-axis accelerometer that can detect taps and free-fall. To make bleeps and bloops, there’s a built in buzzer-speaker. For projects where you need more volume, you can plug in an 8 ohm speaker.</p>

<p>You can power the PyBadge from any of Adafruit’s LiPoly batteries, but <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/category/574">this 400mAh one</a> is suggested. An on-off switch will save battery power when not in use. Or power the board from the Micro USB port - it will also charge the battery if one is attached.</p>

<p>There is a variant on the Adafruit PyBadge, the Adafruit PyBadge LC, which has a subset of the PyBadge features.</p>

<p>By Damien George</p> <p>The pyboard is a compact and powerful electronics development board that runs MicroPython. It connects to your PC over USB, giving you a USB flash drive to save your Python scripts, and a serial Python prompt (a REPL) for instant programming. Requires a micro USB cable, and will work with Windows, Mac and Linux.</p>

<p>There are 3 main ways to control the pyboard:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>REPL:</strong> Connecting to your PC via USB, the board appears as a USB virtual comms port (CDC VCP) and you can use any serial program to connect and get a Python REPL prompt. This allows you to instantly type and execute Python commands, just like you would when running Python on your PC. You can also redirect the REPL to any of the UARTs on the pyboard.</li>
  <li><strong>Remote script:</strong> You can change from REPL to raw REPL mode by sending ctrl-A, and then in raw REPL mode you can send an arbitrary Python script to the board for it to execute immediately. A Python script is available which makes using this mode very simple: you just run python pyboard.py script_to_run.py and this will execute script_to_run.py on the pyboard, returning any output.</li>
  <li><strong>From file:</strong> The pyboard has a small, built-in filesystem which lives in part of the flash memory of the microcontroller. It also has an SD card slot if you want to extend the available storage. When you connect the pyboard to your PC, it appears as a USB flash storage device and you can access (mount) the internal filesystem and the SD card this way. If you copy a Python script to the filesystem and call it main.py then the board will execute this script when it starts up. This way you can run scripts without being connected to a PC.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Main features of the hardware:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>STM32F405RG microcontroller</li>
  <li>168 MHz Cortex M4 CPU with hardware floating point</li>
  <li>1024KiB flash ROM and 192KiB RAM</li>
  <li>Micro USB connector for power and serial communication</li>
  <li>Micro SD card slot, supporting standard and high capacity SD cards</li>
  <li>3-axis accelerometer (MMA7660)</li>
  <li>Real time clock with optional battery backup</li>
  <li>24 GPIO on left and right edges and 5 GPIO on bottom row, plus LED and switch GPIO available on bottom row</li>
  <li>3x 12-bit analog to digital converters, available on 16 pins, 4 with analog ground shielding</li>
  <li>2x 12-bit digital to analog (DAC) converters, available on pins X5 and X6</li>
  <li>4 LEDs (red, green, yellow and blue)</li>
  <li>1 reset and 1 user switch</li>
  <li>On-board 3.3V LDO voltage regulator, capable of supplying up to 300mA, input voltage range 3.6V to 10V</li>
  <li>DFU bootloader in ROM for easy upgrading of firmware</li>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>The Adafruit PyGamer is an entry-level gaming handheld for DIY gaming and maybe a little retro-emulation, all in one compact dev board.</p>

<p>The PyGamer is powered by the ATSAMD51 microcontroller with 512KB of flash and 192KB of RAM. There is an additional 8 MB of QSPI flash for file storage, handy for images, fonts, sounds, or game assets.</p>

<p>On the front, you get a 1.8” 160x128 color TFT display with a dimmable backlight. There is fast DMA support for drawing - screen updates are incredibly fast. A dual-potentiometer analog stick gives great control, with easy diagonal movement, or really any direction you like.
There are also 4 square-top buttons which fit <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4228">square top button caps</a> (available separately). The buttons are arranged to mimic a gaming handheld, with 2 menu-select buttons and 2 fire-action buttons. There are also 5 NeoPixel LEDs below the LCD screen to dazzle or track activity.</p>

<p>On the back, there is a full Feather-compatible header socket set to allow plugging in any FeatherWing, providinge expansion of the PyGamer’s capabilities. There are 3 integrated STEMMA connectors: two 3-pin with ADC/PWM capability and one 4-pin that connects to I2C -  this can be used for Grove sensors as well.</p>

<p>For built in sensors, there’s a light sensor that points out the front, and a 3-axis accelerometer that can detect taps and free-fall. To make bleeps and bloops, plug in any set of stereo headphones. For projects where you need more volume, you can plug in an 8 ohm speaker. The PyGamer will auto-switch to speakers when they’re plugged in.</p>

<p>You can power the PyGamer from any Adafruit LiPoly battery, but <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2750">this 350mAh one</a> is suggested as it will fit into the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4238">Adafruit PyGamer acrylic case</a> (sold separately). An on-off switch will save battery power when not in use. Or power the PyGamer from the Micro USB port - it will also charge up the battery if one is attached.</p>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p><strong>PyPortal</strong>, is Adafruit’s easy-to-use IoT device that allows you to create all the things for the “Internet of Things” in minutes. Make custom touch screen interface GUIs, all open-source, and Python-powered using tinyJSON / APIs to get news, stock, weather, cat photos, and more – all over Wi-Fi with the latest technologies. Create little pocket universes of joy that connect to something good. Rotate it 90 degrees, it’s a web-connected conference badge #badgelife.</p>

<p>The PyPortal uses an ATMEL (Microchip) ATSAMD51J20, and an Espressif ESP32 Wi-Fi coprocessor with TLS/SSL support built-in. PyPortal has a <strong>3.2″ 320 x 240 color TFT</strong> with resistive touch screen. PyPortal includes: speaker, light sensor, temperature sensor, NeoPixel, microSD card slot, 8MB flash, plug-in ports for I2C and 2 analog/digital pins, 3D files for custom enclosures / lanyard fastening. Open-source hardware, and Open-Source software, and CircuitPython. The device shows up as a USB drive and the code (Python) can be edited in any IDE, text editor, etc.</p>

<p>The M4 and ESP32 are a great couple - and each bring their own strengths to this board. The SAMD51 M4 has native USB so it can show up like a disk drive, act as a MIDI or HID keyboard/mouse, and of course bootload and debug over a serial port. It also has DACs, ADC, PWM, and tons of GPIO. Meanwhile, the ESP32 has secure WiFi capabilities, and plenty of Flash and RAM to buffer sockets. By letting the ESP32 focus on the complex TLS/SSL computation and socket buffering, it frees up the SAMD51 to act as the user interface. You get a great programming experience thanks to the native USB with files available for drag-n-drop, and you don’t have to spend a ton of processor time and memory to do SSL encryption/decryption and certificate management. It’s the best of both worlds!</p>

Also, we’ve updated the connector to be a reverse-friendly <strong>USB C</strong> connector.</p>

<p><strong>Compared to the original PyPortal, the Titano does not include a ADT7410 temperature sensor. It also has a higher-resolution screen with a different controller chip.

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>CircuitPython rules! The PyRuler is the first ruler to be able to run CircuitPython. It features an embedded Adafruit Trinket M0, which is a tiny microcontroller board, built around the Atmel ATSAMD21E18 powerhouse.</p>

<p>The first time you soldered up a surface mount component you may have been surprised “these are really small parts!” and there’s dozens of different names too! QFN, TDFN, SOIC, SOP, J-Lead, what do they mean and how can you tell how big they are? On the reverse side of the PyRuler, just like with our PCB ruler, you have a reference board right at your fingertips.</p>

<p>While you can use the PyRuler with the Arduino IDE, it ships with CircuitPython on board. When you plug it in, it will show up as a very small disk drive with code.py on it. Edit code.py with your favorite text editor to build your project using Python, the most popular programming language. No installs, IDE or compiler needed, so you can use it on any computer, even ChromeBooks or computers you can’t install software on. When you’re done, unplug the Trinket M0 and your code will go with you. CircuitPython is easier to code but not as low-level and complete as Arduino.</p>

<p>By Raspberry Pi</p> <p>The Raspberry Pi foundation changed single-board computing when they released the Raspberry Pi computer, now they’re ready to do the same for microcontrollers with the release of the brand new <strong>Raspberry Pi Pico</strong>. This low-cost microcontroller board features a powerful new chip, the <strong>RP2040</strong>, and all the fixin’s to get started with embedded electronics projects at a stress-free price.</p>

<p>The Pico is 0.825” x 2” and can have headers soldered in for use in a breadboard or perfboard, or can be soldered directly onto a PCB with the castellated pads. There’s 20 pads on each side, with groups of general purpose input-and-output (GPIO) pins interleaved with plenty of ground pins. All of the GPIO pins are 3.3V logic, and are not 5V-safe so stick to 3V! You get a total of 25 GPIO pins (technically there are 26 but IO #15 has a special purpose and should not be used by projects), 3 of those can be analog inputs (the chip has 4 ADC but one is not broken out). There are no true analog output (DAC) pins.</p>

<p>On the slim green board is minimal circuitry to get you going: A 5V to 3.3V power supply converter, single green LED on GP25, boot select button, RP2040 chip with dual-core Cortex M0, 2 MegaBytes of QSPI flash storage, and crystal.</p>

<p><strong>Inside the RP2040 is a ‘permanent ROM’ USB UF2 bootloader.</strong> What that means is when you want to program new firmware, you can hold down the BOOTSEL button while plugging it into USB (or pulling down the RUN/Reset pin to ground) and it will appear as a USB disk drive you can drag the firmware onto. Folks who have been using Adafruit products will find this very familiar - we use the technique all our native-USB boards. Just note you don’t double-click reset, instead hold down BOOTSEL during boot to enter the bootloader!</p>

<p>The RP2040 is a powerful chip, which has the clock speed of our M4 (SAMD51), and two cores that are equivalent to our M0 (SAMD21). Since it is an M0 chip, it does not have a floating point unit, or DSP hardware support - so if you’re doing something with heavy floating point math, it will be done in software and thus not as fast as an M4. For many other computational tasks, you’ll get close-to-M4 speeds!</p>

<p>For peripherals, there are two I2C controllers, two SPI controllers, and two UARTs that are multiplexed across the GPIO - check the pinout for what pins can be set to which. There are 16 PWM channels, each pin has a channel it can be set to (ditto on the pinout).</p>

<p>You’ll note there’s no I2S peripheral, or SDIO, or camera, what’s up with that? Well instead of having specific hardware support for serial-data-like peripherals like these, the RP2040 comes with the PIO state machine system which is a unique and powerful way to create custom hardware logic and data processing blocks that run on their own without taking up a CPU. For example, NeoPixels - often we bitbang the timing-specific protocol for these LEDs. For the RP2040, we instead use a PIO object that reads in the data buffer and clocks out the right bitstream with perfect accuracy. Same with I2S audio in or out, LED matrix displays, 8-bit or SPI based TFTs, even VGA! In MicroPython and CircuitPython you can create PIO control commands to script the peripheral and load it in at runtime. There are 2 PIO peripherals with 4 state machines each.</p>

<p><strong>There is <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk">great C/C++ support</a>, unofficial (but really good) <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/rp2040-arduino-with-the-earlephilhower-core">Arduino support</a> an official <a href="https://micropython.org/download/?mcu=rp2040">MicroPython port</a>, and a CircuitPython port!</strong> We of course <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython">recommend CircuitPython because we think its the easiest way to get started</a> and it has support with most our drivers, displays, sensors, and more, supported out of the box so you can follow along with our CircuitPython projects and tutorials.</p>

<p>While the RP2040 has lots of onboard RAM (264KB), it does not have built in FLASH memory. Instead that is provided by the external QSPI flash chip. On this board there is 2MB, which is shared between the program its running and any file storage used by MicroPython or CircuitPython. When using C/C++ you get the whole flash memory, if using Python you will have about 1 MB remaining for code, files, images, fonts, etc.</p>

<p><strong>RP2040 Chip features:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Dual ARM Cortex-M0+ @ 133MHz</li>
  <li>264kB on-chip SRAM in six independent banks</li>
  <li>Support for up to 16MB of off-chip Flash memory via dedicated QSPI bus</li>
  <li>DMA controller</li>
  <li>Fully-connected AHB crossbar</li>
  <li>Interpolator and integer divider peripherals</li>
  <li>On-chip programmable LDO to generate core voltage</li>

<p>By Raspberry Pi</p> <p>The Raspberry Pi foundation changed single-board computing when they released the Raspberry Pi computer, now they’re ready to do the same for microcontrollers with the release of the brand new Raspberry Pi Pico W. This low-cost microcontroller board features their powerful new chip, the RP2040, and all the fixin’s to get started with IoT embedded electronics projects at a stress-free price.</p>

<p>Raspberry Pi Pico W brings WiFi + BLE (coming soon) wireless networking to the Pico platform while retaining complete pin compatibility with its older sibling.</p>

<p>Raspberry Pi Pico W is just like the classic Pico but adds on-board single-band 2.4GHz wireless interfaces (802.11n) using the Infineon CYW43439 while retaining the Pico form factor. The on-board 2.4GHz wireless interface has the following features:</p>

<p>Wireless (802.11n), Single-band (2.4 GHz) WiFi with WPA3 and Soft Access Point supporting up to 4 clients
Bluetooth Low Energy - note this isn’t supported in software yet, its just a hardware capability.
The wireless interface is connected via SPI to the RP2040 microcontroller and has a micropython driver for wireless capability
Due to pin limitations (the Pico brings out all the GPIO) some of the wireless interface pins are shared with the exposed pads:</p>

<p>The SPI CLK is shared with VSYS monitor, so only when there isn’t an SPI transaction in progress can VSYS be read via the ADC.
The Infineon CYW43439 SPI DIN/DOUT and IRQ all share one pin on the RP2040. Only when an SPI transaction isn’t in progress is it suitable to check for IRQs.
The interface typically runs at 33MHz.
For best wireless performance, the antenna should be in free space. For instance, putting metal under or close by the antenna can reduce its performance both in terms of gain and bandwidth. Adding grounded metal to the sides of the antenna can improve the antenna’s bandwidth.</p>

<p>The Pico W is 51mm × 21mm × 1mm and can have headers soldered in for use in a breadboard or perfboard, or can be soldered directly onto a PCB with the castellated pads. There’s 20 pads on each side, with groups of general purpose input-and-output (GPIO) pins interleaved with plenty of ground pins.

<p>By Raspberry Pi</p> <p>The <strong>Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4</strong> is based on the <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/product/4297">Raspberry Pi 4 Model B</a>, but in a smaller form factor - perfect for embedding into products or projects without the bulk of a classic Raspberry Pi. You get all the computational power of Raspberry Pi 4 in a compact form factor for deeply embedded applications. The CM4 incorporates the same quad-core ARM Cortex-A72 processor, dual video output, gigabit Ethernet, UART, I2C, SPI, I2S, and a few PWM for good measure.</p>

<p>This module is available in <strong>multiple variants</strong>, with a range of RAM and eMMC Flash options, and with or without wireless connectivity. The modules are available with 1GB, 2GB, 4GB or 8GB LPDDR4-3200 SDRAM with optional storage of 8GB, 16GB or 32GB eMMC Flash. The wireless option includes 2.4GHz and 5GHz 802.11b/g/n/ac wireless LAN and Bluetooth 5.0 for BT classic and BTLE support.</p>

<h5 id="this-product-version-of-the-cm4-modules-comes-with-4gb-ram-32gb-mmc-and-wifi"><strong>This product version of the CM4 modules comes with 4GB RAM 32GB MMC, and WiFi!</strong></h5>

<p><strong>Note: We don’t include the <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/product/4787">Compute Module IO board</a>, but it’s strongly recommended!</strong></p>

<p>Compute ALL the THINGs!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4092">Compared to the earlier Compute Module 3+</a>, the CM4 features faster CPU cores, better multimedia, more interfacing capabilities, a range of RAM densities, and a wireless connectivity option. Instead of a DIMM socket, there are two board-to-board connectors that carry high-speed signals with ease - like multiple MIPI displays and camera ports. In addition to all the pins that supply Ethernet and SDIO and SPI and such, there’s also 28 GPIO pins, with up to 6 × UART, 6 × I2C and 5 × SPI.</p>

<p>On the video side, there are dual HDMI output, VideoCore VI graphics with OpenGL ES 3.x support, 4Kp60 hardware decode of H.265 (HEVC) video, and 1080p30 hardware encode of H.264 (AVC) video.</p>

<p>It’s great for industrial control or robotic use, digital/video signage, IoT, and AI/machine learning projects</p>

<p>Compute Module 4 introduces a brand new form factor and a compatibility break with earlier Compute Modules. Where previous modules adopted the JEDEC DDR2 SODIMM mechanical standard, with I/O signals on an edge connector, we now bring I/O signals to two high-density perpendicular connectors (one for power and low-speed interfaces, and one for high-speed interfaces).</p>

<p>This significantly reduces the overall footprint of the module on its carrier board, letting you achieve smaller form factors for your products. This version is intended for experienced developers who will be using the board for industrial and commercial applications.</p>

<p><strong>Specifications</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>1.5GHz quad-core 64-bit ARM Cortex-A72 CPU</li>
  <li>VideoCore VI graphics, supporting OpenGL ES 3.x</li>

<p>At first glance, the Pi Zero isn’t much.  It just looks like a slimmed down version of the Raspberry Pi we know and love.  But when we started to think of the possibilities - and what a well-chosen set of accessories could add - we realized the appeal.  And then we saw the price…could it be true? Yes!</p>

<p>This is the slimmest, most pared down Raspberry Pi to date.  It’s kind of like the little cousin to the Pi 2 - with just a micro SD card slot, a mini HDMI port, two micro USB ports (one for power, one for USB), and 512MB of RAM. It has a single-core 1 GHz processor chip, similar to the Pi A+ and B+.</p>

<p>By Raspberry Pi</p> <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Not all features are supported in CircuitPython.</p>

<p><strong>Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W</strong> is the latest product in Raspberry Pi’s most affordable range of single-board computers. The successor to the breakthrough Raspberry Pi Zero W, <strong>Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W</strong> is a form factor–compatible drop-in replacement for the original board.</p>

<p>The board incorporates a quad-core 64-bit Arm Cortex-A53 CPU, clocked at 1GHz. At its heart is a Raspberry Pi RP3A0 system-in-package (SiP), integrating a Broadcom BCM2710A1 die with 512MB of LPDDR2 SDRAM. The upgraded processor provides Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W with 40% more single-threaded performance, and five times more multi-threaded performance, than the original single-core Raspberry Pi Zero. Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W offers 2.4GHz 802.11 b/g/n wireless LAN and Bluetooth 4.2, along with support for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and modular compliance certification.</p>

<p>The board has a microSD card slot, a CSI-2 camera connector, a USB On-The-Go (OTG) port, and an unpopulated footprint for a HAT-compatible 40-pin GPIO header. It is powered via a micro USB socket. Video output is via a mini HDMI port; composite video output can easily be made available via test points, if needed. Sharing the same form factor as the original Raspberry Pi Zero, Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W fits inside most existing Raspberry Pi Zero cases.</p>

<p>By Raytac Corporation</p> <p>This USB dongle/key type thing is a little unusual - it <em>isn’t</em> a BLE adapter that you plug into a computer to add wireless capability. (If you do want something like that, our <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/1327">Bluetooth 4.0 USB Module</a> will do the job nicely.) Instead, this is basically a minimal nRF52840 wireless microcontroller dev board on a stick. You can program it in Arduino or CircuitPython and it’s completely standalone. This could be useful for some situations where you want to have a standalone BLE device that communicates with a USB host <em>but without dealing with the operating system’s BLE stack</em>.</p>

<p>Each MDBT50Q-RX dongle comes pre-programmed with the TinyUF2 bootloader, which makes loading code onto it very easy (note that only the ones from Adafruit do this, its a special-order item). To enter the bootloader, hold down the dongle’s button while inserting into USB. The button can be used in Arduino/CircuitPython as an input. There’s also a single blue LED indicator. It’s all very simple but we could see situations where perhaps this acts as a beacon, a OS-less BLE interface or bridge, or a compact development board for experimenting with the nRF52840.</p>

<p>The blue LED is connected to P1.13, set that pin to be an output and pull low to turn on the LED</p>

<p>The button is connected to P0.15, set that pin to be an input with an internal pullup - when pressed the pin will go low.</p>

<p>Of course the best way to program these chips is with the Nordic SDK. This chip also has <a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Arduino">some basic Arduino support</a>, <a href="https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/tree/main/ports/nrf">CircuitPython support</a>, and is <a href="https://mynewt.apache.org/latest/tutorials/blinky/nRF52.html">supported by MyNewt</a>.</p>

<p>By Microchip</p> <p>The SAM E54 Xplained Pro evaluation kit is a hardware platform for evaluating the ATSAME54P20A microcontroller (MCU). Supported by the Studio integrated development platform, the kit provides easy access to the features of the ATSAME54P20A and explains how to integrate the device into a custom design.</p>

<p>In addition to ATSAME54P20A, the SAM E54 Xplained Pro Evaluation kit can also be used for evaluating the ATSAMD51P20A microcontroller as both MCUs are identical in pin count and peripherals except that ATSAMD51P20A does not have Ethernet and CAN FD.</p>

<p>The Xplained Pro MCU series evaluation kits include an on-board Embedded Debugger, eliminating the need for external tools to program or debug the ATSAME54P20A. The kits offers additional peripherals to extend the features of the board and ease the development of custom designs.</p>

<p>Note: Not all peripherals are supported by CircuitPython.  The Ethernet, CAN, and Q-Touch button are not supported by CircuitPython at this time.  Only 16MB (128MiB) of the QSPI flash is accessible via the CIRCUITPY drive.</p>

<p>CircuitPython requires that the board be flashed with the UF2 bootloader.  This can be done using the second USB connector, which provides a debug interface.  After this has been done once, CircuitPython can be installed and updated in the usual way using the UF2 bootloader, or by using the debug USB connector.</p>

    <title>Seeeduino XIAO - Keyboard Optimized</title>

<p>By Seeed Studio</p> <h1 id="keyboard-optimized">Keyboard Optimized</h1>

<p>Due to the limited memory and flash of the ATSAMD21G18, an optimized build of CircuitPython is needed for keyboard/keypad/macropad projects.  The following modules are made available:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>keypad</strong> for handing buttons and key matrices</li>
  <li><strong>rotaryio</strong> for handling rotary encoders</li>
  <li><strong>usb_hid</strong> for sending HID messages to the computer</li>
  <li><strong>adafruit_hid</strong> (frozen module) for configuring your Xiao as a keyboard</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that a number of modules are removed to make space for those listed above. It is assumed that a keyboard or macropad doesn’t have sensors. As such, these modules are <strong>not</strong> included:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>busio</strong> needed for I2C, SPI and UART</li>
  <li><strong>pulseio</strong> needed some sensors</li>
  <li><strong>onewireio</strong> needed for 1-wire devices</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need one of the modules removed or if you want to absolutely be sure that you don’t run out of memory, consider using a better processor (RP2040 for example).</p>

<p>This build was tested with a 30 keys macropad which is the largest matrix the XIAO allows for (5x6 matrix = 11 GPIOs).</p>

<p>By Seeed Studio</p> <p>Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040 is a microcontroller using the Raspberry RP2040 chip. It runs at up to 133 MHz, is built with rich interfaces in a tiny thumb size, and fully supports Arduino, MicroPython, and CircuitPython.</p>

<p>The XIAO RP2040 is a development board of the Seeed Studio XIAO series. Like the Seeed Studio XIAO SAMD21, it is a compact board with a wide range of interfaces. The XIAO RP2040 is equipped with the Raspberry RP2040 chip (Dual-core ARM® Cortex® M0+) and has 2 MB of Flash on board.</p>

<p>Interfaces:</p>

<ul>
  <li>11 digital pins</li>
  <li>4 analog pins</li>
  <li>11 PWM Pins</li>
  <li>1 I2C interface</li>
  <li>1 UART interface</li>
  <li>1 SPI interface</li>
  <li>1 SWD Bonding pad interface</li>
</ul>

<p>Some PINs have various functions, Moreover, XIAO RP2040 supports the USB-C interface which can supply power and download code. 1 Reset button, 1 BOOT button, 1 user-programmable RGB LED, 1 power LED, 2 status indicators, and 1 user LED are on board, allowing developers to debug their code very easily.</p>

<p>The XIAO RP2040 is very compact because all electronic components are soldered on the same board surface, which means you can easily solder the XIAO RP2040 to your own PCB. XIAO RP2040 is pin-compatible with Seeed Studio XIAO SAMD21, so XIAO RP2040 can be learned and developed using the Expansion board of Seeeduino XIAO.</p>

<p>By arturo182</p> <p>There are two Serpente boards, they are both virtually the same, except for the USB connector. The standard Serpente board contains a USB-C connector, and the Serpente Plug uses the board itself as a Type-A USB plug.</p>

<p>If you are familiar with the Digispark boards, you may notice some similarities. This fact is of course not incidental, the Serpente boards are inspired by the Digispark, both in form-factor as well as use-cases. The Serpente boards are meant to be used as quick and dirty, yet flexible, prototyping tools.</p>

<p>By Silicognition LLC</p> <p>This board is a electrically a clone of the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3857">Adafruit Feather M4 Express</a>, but physically optimized to fit on top of the <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/silicognition/poe-featherwing">PoE-FeatherWing</a>, filling the empty space around the RJ45 and flyback transformer and allowing the creation of extremely compact Power over Ethernet systems.</p>

<p>Just like the original Feather M4 Express, it is powered by the ATSAMD51J19 - with its 120MHz Cortex M4 with floating point support and 512KB Flash and 192KB RAM.  It also has 2MB of SPI flash on board.  The only thing missing compared to the original is the battery charger, which was deemed expendable for Power over Ethernet systems.  The board comes with a UF2 bootloader for easy Arduino and CircuitPython compatibility, and has CircuitPython with Wiznet W5500 drivers pre-installed, plus a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">poe_featherwing.py</code> module that sets the Ethernet connection up for you!</p>

<p>By Silicognition LLC</p> <p>This board is an alternative to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/M4-Shim-Feather-PoE-FeatherWing-Ultra-Compact-Vertical/dp/B0971PKDV7/">Silicognition M4-Shim</a>, and just like that board it is specifically made to fit on top of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Silicognition-PoE-FeatherWing-Ethernet-802-3at-Feather/dp/B08KTVD7BR/">PoE-FeatherWing</a>, filling the empty space around the RJ45 and flyback transformer and allowing the creation of extremely compact Power over Ethernet systems.</p>

<p>Since the ATSAMD51J19 used on the M4-Shim is pretty much unobtainium right now, I needed to provide an alternative, and with good availability and popularity of the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2040/">RP2040</a> this chip seemed like a natural choice.  You get dual ARM Cortex-M0+ @ 133 MHz, 264 kB on-chip SRAM, PIO and 4 MB of QSPI flash!</p>

<p>The RP2040 comes with built-in UF2 bootloader, and the board has CircuitPython with Wiznet W5500 drivers pre-installed, plus a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">poe_featherwing.py</code> module that sets the Ethernet connection up for you.</p>

<p>A special feature of this board is a custom chip to enable the familiar single-press to reset, double-press for bootloader button!  So from a user experience point of view, it behaves the same as the M4-Shim.</p>

<p>By Solder Party</p> <p>A BB Q20 Keyboard in USB/PMOD/Qwiic format with a injection molded clear plastic case.</p>

<p>This is the evolution of our previous BBQ10 PMOD board. We took all the feedback from that board and improved on the design in every way.</p>

<p>We added a Qwiic/Stemma QT connector, we added USB HID support, we changed to a Q20 keyboard, which gave us four extra buttons, and the optical trackpad that works as a USB HID Mouse. And we decided to put the whole thing into a custom-designed injection molded clear plastic case for better usability and durability, as well as that retro 90s look.</p>

<p>The board uses the Raspberry Pi RP2040 MCU to poll the keyboard and trackpad and put the key press information into a FIFO.</p>

<p>You can use the I2C interface to read the FIFO, reconfigure the chip, and change the keyboar backlight.</p>

<p>In addition to that, the board also has a USB Type-C socket, and when connected to a desktop computer (Windows/Linux/MacOS), a smartphone (iOS/Android), or a SBC (Raspberry Pi, etc), it enumerates as a USB HID Keyboard and Mouse combo!</p>

<p>The firmware can be configured over USB using the Vendor Class interface.</p>

<p>The I2C interface is compatible with the old BBQ10 module, you can use the same libraries to interface this board.</p>

<p>Note: This board is not 5V-tolerant!</p>

<p>By Solder Party</p> <p>The Stamp was created to allow you to use the <strong>Raspberry Pi RP2040</strong> in your designs without having to solder small-pitch QFN chips or worry about lots of external circuitry.</p>

<p>All you need to get you started is a 5V supply or a LiPo battery. The Stamp will take care of the charging and switching the power sources.</p>

<p>The castellated edges with <strong>2mm pitch</strong> can be hand-soldered directly to a carrier board or by using pin headers. You can find footprints for many PCB programs <a href="https://github.com/solderparty/rp2040_stamp_footprints">here</a>.</p>

<p>At only <strong>1 by 1 inch</strong>, the Stamp packs a lot of features:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>8MB of FLASH</strong></li>
  <li><strong>500mA 3.3V LDO</strong></li>
  <li><strong>All 30 GPIOs broken out</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A Neopixel</strong></li>
  <li>LiPo supply and charging circuit (with charging LED)</li>
  <li>USB broken out</li>
  <li>SWD broken out</li>
  <li>Reset Button</li>
  <li>12MHz crystal</li>
</ul>

<p>and of course, everything that comes with the Raspberry Pi RP2040 itself:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dual core ARM Cortex-M0+ @ 133MHz</li>
  <li>264kB SRAM</li>
  <li>2 UARTs</li>
  <li>2 SPIs</li>
  <li>2 I2Cs</li>
  <li>16 PWM channels</li>
  <li>USB with Host and Device support</li>
</ul>

<p>The RP2040 comes with a pre-programmed ROM UF2 Bootloader, by pulling the BOOTSEL pin low and resetting, or by double-pressing the RESET button (if the FW supports it), you can upload new firmware using the USB disk drive.</p>

<p>In addition to the Stamp, we also offer a reference design - the RP2040 Stamp Carrier.</p>

<p>The CircuitPython firmware for the Stamp comes with a built-in board file for the Carrier, you can access it using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">import stamp_carrier_board as board</code>. After that, you can access all the Carrier pins and interfaces like you would with any other CPY board.</p>

<p>By SparkFun</p> <p>The LumiDrive LED Driver is SparkFun’s foray into all things Python on micro-controllers. With the SparkFun LumiDrive you will be able to control and personalize a whole strand of APA102s directly from the board itself. We’ve broken out a number of analog and digital pins from the on board SAMD21G-AU microcontroller to incorporate your own external buttons, switches, and other interfaces to interact with your addressable LED strip.</p>

<p>It feels like Arduino, but without the need to upload and compile code. Because the LumiDrive opens up like a USB drive on your computer when you plug it in and the code you write lives directly inside the drive it feels very much like an Arduino-device. The fact that you don’t need to upload and compile code makes it a great transitionary LED driver from your traditional Arduino!</p>

<p>The SparkFun LumiDrive has been equipped with a USB-C connector which is capable enough to supply up to 1.5 Amps from a 3.1 USB port, a LiPo connector and charge circuit for portable power, as well as two poke-home connectors to allow you to plug in wires without the need for solder.</p>

<p>By SparkFun</p> <p>The SparkFun Pro nRF52840 Mini is a breakout and development board for Nordic Semiconductor’s nRF52840 – a powerful combination of ARM Cortex-M4 CPU and 2.4GHz Bluetooth radio. With the nRF52840 at the heart of your project, you’ll be presented with a seemingly endless list of project-possibilities in an incredibly small package.</p>

<p>SparkFun’s mini development board for the nRF52840 breaks out most of the critical I/O pins including GPIO and those needed for power while maintaining a small footprint that nearly matches that of the Arduino Pro Mini (except those covered by the Qwiic Connector). It features a USB interface (using the nRF52840’s native USB support), which can be used to program, power, and communicate with the chip making it able to be used for any purpose (UART, I2C, SPI) that those of the Arduino Pro Mini could. The Pro nRF52840 Mini features a Raytac MDBT50Q-P1M module. This module connects the nRF52840 to a trace antenna, fits the IC into an FCC-approved footprint, and also includes a lot of the decoupling and timing mechanisms that would otherwise be required for a bare nRF52840 design. Also included onboard is a LiPo battery charger, a Qwiic connector, an on/off switch, a reset switch, and a user LED/button.</p>

<p>The board comes pre-programmed with a USB bootloader. You can develop programs for the nRF52840’s Cortex-M4 using either Arduino, CircuitPython, or C (using Nordic’s nRF5 SDK), and load that compiled code using a USB serial or mass-storage interface.</p>

<p>By Cedar Grove Studios</p> <p>The Cedar Grove StringCar M0 Express is an ATSAMD21-based CircuitPython compatible board used to control a simple string car racer robot. The board is architecturally similar to the Adafruit Trinket M0 and ItsyBitsy M0 Express microcontroller boards with the addition of battery management and a DC motor controller. This board features JST connectors for the racer’s battery, motor output, and sensor input. LiPo battery management charge rate is 500mA. For sensor experimentation, a 3.3-volt Stemma-QT connection is available on-board. The micro-USB connector used for REPL operation, operational status data output, and battery charging. On-board flash memory size is 2MB.</p>

<p>The StringCar M0 Express board will not be sold. The GitHub repository will contain all design files and links for the BOM and the shared OSH Park project.</p>

<p>The string car racer is a simple one-motor robot that is suspended from a string using a pulley attached to the motor shaft. Its challenge is to race back and forth from one end of a taut string to the other. The fastest car wins. The controller board uses sensor switches to detect the ends of the string, calculate the string length, then control motor speed and braking to avoid string-end collisions.</p>

<p>The objective is to create a string car racer that can autonomously learn about its environment and adjust tradeoffs for speed and battery longevity. CircuitPython is used to easily add and interactively adjust performance features such as motor and battery efficiency, end-of-string collision avoidance, string length calculation, and predictive braking. Also, being able to watch its own battery status means that it’ll always return to the home end of the string when battery capacity begins to wane. Circuit Python also supports libraries that abstract string car functions, simplifying the primary code module to make it easier for novice programmers to get involved in customizing  string car racer operation.</p>

<p>By Blues Wireless</p> <p>Swan is a low-cost embeddable STM32L4-based microcontroller designed to accelerate the development and deployment of battery-powered solutions. It is especially useful for applications requiring large memory or a high degree of I/O expandability at an affordable cost, such as edge inferencing and remote monitoring.</p>

<p>Uniquely for Feather-compatible boards, Swan is designed to satisfy developers’ needs that span from early prototyping through high-volume deployment. Developers may begin to use Swan in conjunction with Adafruit’s myriad sensors and FeatherWing-compatible carriers. Due to its novel design, for high-volume deployment the low-cost Swan can also be soldered directly to a parent PCB integrating those sensors, utilizing the full range of Swan’s I/O capabilities.</p>

<p>The board has three independent power options – USB, Battery, or Line power – and provides a software-switchable 2 Amp regulator for powering external sensors. When operating in its low-power operating mode, the entire Swan board commonly draws only about 8uA while retaining all of its memory, making it quite suitable for battery-powered devices.</p>

<p>By PJRC</p> <p>Who else could pack a 600 MHz microcontroller into such a Teensy little board? The Teensy 4.0 features an ARM Cortex-M7 processor at 600 MHz, with a NXP iMXRT1062 chip, the fastest microcontroller available today - <a href="https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/CoreMark">ten times faster than the Teensy 3.2</a>! The NXP iMXRT1062 is a ‘cross-over’ processor, which has the functionality of a microcontroller, at the speeds of a microcomputer. It’s perfect for when you need tons of flash, RAM and, to crunch lots of data, or when you need two full speed USB ports. It even has a graphics processor! All this for two sawbucks.</p>

<p>Teensy 4.0 can be programmed using the Arduino IDE with <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html">Teensyduino add-on</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Power Consumption &amp; Management</strong>
When running at 600 MHz, Teensy 4.0 consumes approximately 100 mA current, considerably more than most microcontrollers. To help reduce power, Teensy 4.0 provides support for dynamic clock scaling. Unlike traditional microcontrollers, where changing the clock speed causes wrong baud rates and other issues, Teensy 4.0 hardware and Teensyduino’s software support for Arduino timing functions are designed to allow dynamically speed changes. Serial baud rates, audio streaming sample rates, and Arduino functions like delay() and millis(), and Teensyduino’s extensions like IntervalTimer and elapsedMillis, continue to work properly while the CPU changes speed.</p>

<p>Teensy 4.0 also provides a power shut off feature. By connecting a pushbutton to the On/Off pin, the 3.3V power supply can be completely disabled by holding the button for 5 seconds, and turned back on by a brief button press. If a coin cell is connected to VBAT, Teensy 4.0’s RTC also continues to keep track of date &amp; time while the power is off.</p>

<p>Teensy 4.0 also can also be overclocked, well beyond 600 MHz!</p>

<p><strong>Technical Specifications</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>ARM Cortex-M7 at 600 MHz</li>
  <li>1024K RAM (512K is tightly coupled)</li>
  <li>2048K Flash (64K reserved for recovery &amp; EEPROM emulation)</li>

<p>By PJRC</p> <p>The <a href="http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/index.html">Teensy</a> 4.1, like the <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/product/4323">4.0</a>, also features an ARM Cortex-M7 processor at 600 MHz, with an NXP iMXRT1062 chip, the fastest microcontroller available today - <a href="https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/CoreMark">ten times faster than the Teensy 3.2</a>!

It’s perfect for when you need tons of flash, RAM and, to crunch lots of data, or when you need two full-speed USB ports.</p>

<p>Teensy 4.1 comes with <strong>four times larger flash memory than the 4.0</strong>, and two new locations to optionally add more memory. The Teensy 4.1 has the same form factor as the <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/product/3266">Teensy 3.6</a> (2.4” by 0.7”), but provides a <strong>ton more I/O capability</strong>, including an 100MB Ethernet PHY, SD card socket (SDIO connected), and USB host port. Please check out the <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy40.html">Teensy 4.0 page for common specifications and features</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Memory</strong></p>

<p>The bottom side of Teensy 4.1 has locations to solder 2 memory chips. The smaller location is meant for a PSRAM SOIC-8 chip. The larger location is intended for QSPI flash memory.</p>

<p><strong>USB Host</strong></p>

<p>Teensy 4.1’s USB Host port allows you to connect USB devices, like keyboards and MIDI musical instruments. A 5 pin header and a USB Host cable are needed to be able to plug in a USB device. <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/?q=usb%20breakout%20cable">You can also use one of these cables to connect to the USB pins</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Power Consumption &amp; Management</strong></p>

<p>When running at 600 MHz, the Teensy 4.1 consumes approximately 100mA current and provides support for dynamic clock scaling. Unlike traditional microcontrollers, where changing the clock speed causes wrong baud rates and other issues, Teensy 4.1 hardware and Teensyduino’s software support for Arduino timing functions are designed to allow dynamically speed changes. Serial baud rates, audio streaming sample rates, and Arduino functions like delay() and millis(), and Teensyduino’s extensions like IntervalTimer and elapsedMillis, continue to work properly while the CPU changes speed. Teensy 4.1 also provides a power shut off feature. By connecting a pushbutton to the On/Off pin, the 3.3V power supply can be completely disabled by holding the button for five seconds, and turned back on by a brief button press. If a coin cell is connected to VBAT, Teensy 4.1’s RTC also continues to keep track of date &amp; time while the power is off. Teensy 4.1 also can also be overclocked, well beyond 600MHz!</p>

<p>The ARM Cortex-M7 brings many powerful CPU features to a true real-time microcontroller platform. The Cortex-M7 is a dual-issue superscaler processor, meaning the M7 can execute two instructions per clock cycle, at 600MHz! Of course, executing two simultaneously depends upon the compiler ordering instructions and registers. Initial benchmarks have shown C++ code compiled by Arduino tends to achieve two instructions about 40% to 50% of the time while performing numerically intensive work using integers and pointers. The Cortex-M7 is the first ARM microcontroller to use branch prediction. On M4, loops and other code which much branch take three clock cycles. With M7, after a loop has executed a few times, the branch prediction removes that overhead, allowing the branch instruction to run in only a single clock cycle.</p>

<p>Tightly Coupled Memory is a special feature which allows Cortex-M7 fast single cycle access to memory using a pair of 64 bit wide buses. The ITCM bus provides a 64 bit path to fetch instructions. The DTCM bus is actually a pair of 32 bit paths, allowing M7 to perform up to two separate memory accesses in the same cycle. These extremely high speed buses are separate from M7’s main AXI bus, which accesses other memory and peripherals. 512 of memory can be accessed as tightly coupled memory. Teensyduino automatically allocates your Arduino sketch code into ITCM and all non-malloc memory use to the fast DTCM, unless you add extra keywords to override the optimized default. Memory not accessed on the tightly coupled buses is optimized for DMA access by peripherals. Because the bulk of M7’s memory access is done on the two tightly coupled buses, powerful DMA-based peripherals have excellent access to the non-TCM memory for highly efficient I/O.</p>

<p>Teensy 4.1’s Cortex-M7 processor includes a floating point unit (FPU) which supports both 64 bit “double” and 32 bit “float”. With M4’s FPU on Teensy 3.5 &amp; 3.6, and also Atmel SAMD51 chips, only 32 bit float is hardware accelerated. Any use of double, double functions like log(), sin(), cos() means slow software implemented math. Teensy 4.1 executes all of these with FPU hardware.</p>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>The <strong>NeoTrellis M4</strong> is an all-in-one <strong>USB + NeoPixel + Elastomer + Audio</strong> board. It’s powered by the SAMD51, a Cortex M4 core running at 120 MHz. This chip has a speedy core with CircuitPython support, hardware DSP/floating point, dual DACs and all the goodies you expect from normal chips like I2C, ADC, DMA, etc. It has a roomy 512KB of flash and 192KB of SRAM so it’s great for CircuitPython, includes a full 8MB flash chip so tons of space for files and audio clips.</p>

<p>The native USB port can turn it into a MIDI USB device if you like - currently that’s only supported in Arduino. Tether it to a computer or tablet, if you like. Or use it in standalone mode, as long as its powered from a USB power plug, it’ll run whatever firmware is burned into it.</p>

<p>OK so you’ve got this big brain, but now you need inputs and outputs! There’s a 4x8 grid of elastomer button pads with a NeoPixel nestled in the center of each one. You can read any/all button presses simultaneously thanks to the fully diode’d matrix, and also set each button color to any of 24-bit colors. The elastomer buttons are translucent so they glow beautifully when lit.</p>

<p>Time to make some noise! Adafruit picked the SAMD51 mostly because it has dual DACs - that’s two 12-bit, 500KSPS ‘true analog’ outputs connected them to left and right on a standard headphone jack. Since the DAC pins are also ADC pins you could also use the left/right for audio line level <em>input</em> if you so choose. You’re not going to get audiophile-quality outputs from two 12-bit DACs but you can certainly play audio clips and make beeps and bloops.</p>

<p>To add more interactivity, a precision triple-axis accelerometer from Analog Devices, the ADXL343, is included as well, and provides sensor information on tilt, motion, or tapping. Great for adding another dimension of data input in addition to the button pads.</p>

<p>Finally, a 4 pin JST hacking port is available for extra add-ons. It’s STEMMA and Grove compatible, and provides GND, 3.3V power, and two pins that can be used for I2C, ADC, or a UART. So connect some other sensor, or read stereo audio in, or maybe hack together a MIDI port. Whatever you like!</p>

<p>Features:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ATSAMD51 32-bit Cortex M4</strong> core running at <strong>120 MHz</strong> (32-bit, 3.3V logic and power)</li>
  <li>Hardware DSP and floating point support</li>
  <li><strong>512 KB</strong> flash, <strong>192 KB</strong> RAM</li>
  <li>Native USB that can act as a true USB MIDI device if you like.</li>
  <li><strong>8 MB SPI FLASH chip</strong> for storing files and CircuitPython code storage.</li>
  <li>4x8 elastomer pads with fully diode’d matrix - no ghosting!</li>
  <li>4x8 NeoPixels for each pad, glows through the elastomer buttons</li>
  <li>TRRS Headphone jack with stereo DAC outputs on Left/Right, can also be stereo ADC inputs.</li>
  <li>Built in <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1063">MAX4466 electret mic amplifier</a> for mobile phone headsets. ‘Raw’ DC level reading also available on a separate ADC</li>
  <li>4-JST hacking port with 3.3V power, ground, and two GPIO that can be I2C/ADC/UART</li>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>The Adafruit Trinket M0 may be small, but do not be fooled by its size! It’s a tiny microcontroller board, built around the Atmel ATSAMD21, a little chip with <em>a lot</em> of power. Adafruit designed a microcontroller board that was small enough to fit into any project, and low cost enough to use without hesitation. Perfect for when you don’t want to give up your expensive dev-board and you aren’t willing to take apart the project you worked so hard to design. It’s one of the lowest-cost CircuitPython programmable boards!</p>

<p>Adafruit used the same form factor for <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1500">the original ATtiny85-based Trinket</a> and gave it an upgrade. The Trinket M0 has swapped out the lightweight ATtiny85 for a ATSAMD21E18 powerhouse. It’s just as small, and it’s easier to use, so you can do more.</p>

<p>The most exciting part of the Trinket M0 is that while you can use it with the Arduino IDE, it ships with CircuitPython on board. When you plug it in, it will show up as a very small disk drive with code.py on it. Edit code.py with your favorite text editor to build your project using Python, the most popular programming language. No installs, IDE or compiler needed, so you can use it on any computer, even ChromeBooks or computers you can’t install software on. When you’re done, unplug the Trinket M0 and your code will go with you. <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-trinket-m0-circuitpython-arduino/circuitpython">Please check out the Trinket M0 CircuitPython guide for a list of capabilities and quick-start code examples</a> - CircuitPython is easier to code but not as low-level and complete as Arduino.</p>

<p>Here are some of the updates you can look forward to when using Trinket M0:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Same size, form-factor, and pinout as classic Trinket</li>
  <li>Updating ATtiny85 8-bit AVR for ATSAMD21E18 32-bit Cortex M0+</li>
  <li>256KB Flash - 32x as much as 8 KB on ATtiny85</li>
  <li>32 KB RAM - 64x as much as 512 bytes on ATtiny85</li>
  <li>48 MHz 32 bit processor - 6x as fast as ATtiny85 (not even taking into account 32-bit speedups)</li>
  <li>Native USB supported by every OS - can be used in Arduino or CircuitPython as USB serial console, Keyboard/Mouse HID, even a little disk drive for storing Python scripts. (ATtiny85 does not have native USB)</li>
  <li>Can be used with Arduino IDE or CircuitPython</li>
  <li>Built in green ON LED</li>
  <li>Built in red pin #13 LED</li>
  <li>Built in RGB DotStar LED</li>
  <li>All 5 GPIO pins are available and are not shared with USB - so you can use them for whatever you like!
    <ul>
      <li>Five GPIO pins with digital input/output with internally connected pullups or pulldowns</li>
      <li>Three of the I/O pins can be used for 12-bit analog input</li>
      <li>True analog output on one I/O pin - can be used to play 10-bit quality audio clips in Arduino (CircuitPython does not have storage for audio clips)</li>
      <li>We gave the M0 pads the exact same names as the original Trinket so all your existing Arduino code will work exactly the same as-is without changes</li>
      <li>Two high speed PWM outputs - for servos, LEDs, etc</li>
      <li>Three pins can also be used as hardware capacitive touch sensors with no additional components required</li>
      <li>Can drive NeoPixels or DotStars on any pins, with enough memory to drive 8000+ pixels. <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/dma-driven-neopixels">DMA-NeoPixel support on one pin </a>so you can drive pixels without having to spend any processor time on it.</li>
      <li>Native hardware SPI, I2C and Serial available on two pads so you can connect to any I2C or Serial device with true hardware support (no annoying bit-banging). You can have either one SPI device or both I2C and Serial.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Same Reset switch for starting your project code over</li>
  <li>Power with either USB or external output (such as a battery) - it’ll automatically switch over</li>
  <li>Mounting holes! Yeah!</li>
  <li>Really really small</li>
</ul>

<p>Each is fully assembled and tested Trinket M0 with CircuitPython &amp; example code programmed in.</p>

<p>So what are you waiting for? Pick up a Trinket M0 today and be amazed at how easy and fast it is to get started with Trinket and CircuitPython!</p>

<p>By Itaca Innovation</p> <p><strong>Small. Yet powerful!</strong></p>

<p>Despite a size smaller than the ATMEGA328 which powers Arduino Uno, <strong>uChip</strong> mounts the same ATSAMD21 series of Arduino Zero! Everything that runs on Arduino Zero runs also on uChip, at the same speed! However, unlike Arduino Zero, it <strong>fits a 16-pin DIP socket</strong> and it leaves a lot of space on your breadboard. No more bulky shields or flying wires all around your breadboard!</p>

<p>And now uChip runs CircuitPython too!</p>

<p>Unlike many Arduino Zero compatible board, uChip also mounts a high efficiency buck converter, which converts the USB voltage down to 3.3V at up to 1A, which is provided on pin 16, for the external circuitry. A software-selected pass-through mode also allows to output 5V instead of 3.3V. 
uChip can operate also as an USB host. For this purpose, a built-in boost converter can provide up to 500mA to the external USB device, even when the input voltage is as low as 3.3V. The built-in automatic power-path management prevents external power from being fed into an USB port, when uChip is connected to a PC/Mac, and a voltage is provided also externally on pin 16.</p>

<p>You can program uChip using virtually any IDE, in many languages (CircuitPython too!) and you can choose of using either the USB port or an external SWD programmer.</p>

<p><strong>uChip Features:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>CPU: 32-bit Cortex M0+ ATSAMD21-series running at 48 MHz (Arduino Zero Compatible)</li>
  <li>FLASH: 256 kB (248 kB due to integrated bootloader).</li>
  <li>RAM: 32 kB, zero wait states.</li>
  <li>Powered via USB or externally (3.3V to 5V).</li>
  <li>Integrated 500-mA boost and 1-A buck converters and automatic power switching circuitry.</li>
  <li>Each converter can also be individually turned off, e.g. if you want to force power draw exclusively from external pins (self-powered device), or if you want to turn off an external USB device connected with a micro A cable.</li>
  <li>When powered through the USB port, the output voltage on the power pins can be selected via software to be either 3.3V or the USB voltage (typically 5V +/- 10%).</li>
  <li>Pin 15 can be configured (via SMD jumper) as an additional 3.3V auxiliary output @100mA when pin 16 is 5V (either as input or output). By default pin 15 is a regular I/O. If this feature is not used, 5/3.3V (at up to 1A) are still available on pin 16.</li>
  <li>14 I/O pins (2 of them can be used to connect an external SWD programmer/debugger) and 2 power pins (VCC and GND).</li>
  <li>Status LED (it can be turned on/off via software using a single instruction).</li>
  <li>Multi function push button for reset/program.</li>
  <li>8 12-bit ADC inputs.</li>
  <li>10-bit DAC output.</li>
  <li>14 external interrupt input pins.</li>
  <li>Up to 5 serials between SPI, I2C and UART.</li>
  <li>I2S port for audio decoders such as  UDA1334A.</li>
  <li>13 PWM pins.</li>
  <li>Size: 28.5 mm x 10.16 mm (1.1 “ x 0.40 “), including USB port protrusions (27.23 mm x 10.16 mm excluding USB)</li>
  <li>4-layer board for improved noise performance.</li>
  <li>Standards narrow-DIP footprint: 0.3” (7.62 mm) row spacing, 0.1” (2.54) pin spacing.</li>
  <li>Pinout standard logic CMOS compatible: power and GND are on pin 16 and 8, so you can also emulate some 16 pin CMOS ICs (4000 and 74HC series)!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The uChip does not have an RGB LED.</li>
  <li>The on-board LED is amber, rather than green.</li>
  <li>The board’s bootloader is BOSSA-compatible, but does not support UF2, so use a CircuitPython .bin file with BOSSA.  See <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/non-uf2-installation">this page</a> for the general process of using BOSSA.  A Windows .bat script that demonstrates exactly how to use the BOSSAC commandline tool with uChip to flash CircuitPython is available <a href="https://github.com/mew-cx/circuitpython_stuff/tree/main/uChip">here</a>; you may use it as a template and customize as needed.</li>

<p><strong>Onboard 5x5 RGB Matrix? Really?</strong></p>

<p>Yeah, why not! Getting compelling information out of a single RGB LED can be a real challenge, so with a 5x5 matrix, you can scroll text, show icons or even display cool animating patterns!</p>

<p>The RGB Matrix is powered from its own 3.3V LDO, that defaults to the off state, so there is no current draw if you put the FeatherS2 Neo into deep sleep. Turning the power on is as simple as setting IO4 HIGH.</p>

<p>You can find out more about the FeatherS2 Neo at <a href="https://unexpectedmaker.com/feathers2-neo-soon">unexpected maker</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2x LDO Voltage Regulators?</strong>
Yup! The first one is for the general operation of the board and the ESP32-S2, RAM and Flash.</p>

<p>The second LDO is for you to use to connect external 3V3 modules, sensors and peripherals, and it has programmable EN control tied to GPIO21 + it’s connected to the deep sleep capabilities of the S2, so if the S2 goes into deep sleep, the 2nd LDO is automatically shut down for you!</p>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>A new chip means a new Feather, and the Raspberry Pi RP2040 is no exception. When we saw this chip we thought “this chip is going to be awesome when we give it the Feather Treatment” and so we did! This Feather features the <strong>RP2040</strong>, and all niceties you know and love about Feather.</p>

<h2 id="technical-details">Technical details</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Measures 2.0” x 0.9” x 0.28” (50.8 mm x 22.8 mm x 7 mm) without headers soldered in</li>
  <li>Light as a (large?) feather - 5 grams</li>
  <li>RP2040 32-bit Cortex M0+ dual core running at ~125 MHz @ 3.3 V logic and power</li>
  <li>264 KB RAM</li>
  <li><strong>8 MB SPI FLASH</strong> chip for storing files and CircuitPython/MicroPython code storage. No EEPROM</li>
  <li><strong>21 GPIO pins with following capabilities:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Four</strong> 12 bit ADCs (one more than Pico)</li>
      <li>Two I2C, Two SPI and two UART peripherals, we label one for the ‘main’ interface in standard Feather locations</li>
      <li>16 PWM outputs - for servos, LEDs, etc</li>
      <li>The 8 digital ‘non-ADC/non-peripheral’ GPIO are consecutive for maximum PIO compatibility</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Built in 200 mA lipoly charger</strong> with charging status indicator LED</li>
  <li><strong>Pin #13 red LED</strong> for general purpose blinking</li>
  <li><strong>RGB NeoPixel</strong> with power pin on GPIO so you can depower it for low power usages.</li>
  <li>On-board <strong>STEMMA QT connector</strong> that lets you quickly connect any Qwiic, STEMMA QT or Grove I2C devices with no soldering!</li>
  <li><strong>Both Reset button and Bootloader select button for quick restarts (no unplugging-replugging to relaunch code)</strong></li>
  <li>3.3 V Power/enable pin</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/752">Optional SWD debug port can be soldered in for debug access</a></li>
  <li>4 mounting holes</li>
  <li>24 MHz crystal for perfect timing.</li>
  <li>3.3 V regulator with 500 mA peak current output</li>
  <li><strong>USB-C connector</strong> lets you access built-in ROM USB bootloader and serial port debugging</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Inside the RP2040 is a ‘permanent ROM’ USB UF2 bootloader.</strong> What that means is when you want to program new firmware, you can hold down the BOOTSEL button while plugging it into USB (or pulling down the RUN/Reset pin to ground) and it will appear as a USB disk drive you can drag the firmware onto. Folks who have been using Adafruit products will find this very familiar - we use the technique on all our native-USB boards. Just note you don’t double-click reset, instead hold down BOOTSEL during boot to enter the bootloader!</p>

<p>The RP2040 is a powerful chip, which has the clock speed of our M4 (SAMD51), and two cores that are equivalent to our M0 (SAMD1). Since it is an M0 chip, it does not have a floating point unit, or DSP hardware support - so if you’re doing something with heavy floating-point math, it will be done in software and thus not as fast as an M4. For many other computational tasks, you’ll get close-to-M4 speeds!</p>

<p>For peripherals, there are two I2C controllers, two SPI controllers, and two UARTs that are multiplexed across the GPIO - check the pinout for what pins can be set to which. There are 16 PWM channels, each pin has a channel it can be set to (ditto on the pinout).</p>

<p>You’ll note there’s no I2S peripheral, or SDIO, or camera, what’s up with that? Well instead of having specific hardware support for serial-data-like peripherals like these, the RP2040 comes with the PIO state machine system which is a unique and powerful way to create custom hardware logic and data processing blocks that run on their own without taking up a CPU. For example, NeoPixels - often we bitbang the timing-specific protocol for these LEDs. For the RP2040, we instead use PIO object that reads in the data buffer and clocks out the right bitstream with perfect accuracy. Same with I2S audio in or out, LED matrix displays, 8-bit or SPI based TFTs, even VGA! In MicroPython and CircuitPython you can create PIO control commands to script the peripheral and load it in at runtime. There are 2 PIO peripherals with 4 state machines each.</p>

<p><strong>At the time of launch, there is no Arduino core support for this board. There is great <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk">C/C++ support</a>, an official <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/micropython">MicroPython port</a>, and a <a href="/downloads">CircuitPython port</a>!</strong> We of course <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython">recommend CircuitPython because we think it’s the easiest way to get started</a> and it has support with most of our drivers, displays, sensors, and more, supported out of the box so you can follow along with our CircuitPython projects and tutorials.</p>

<p>While the RP2040 has lots of onboard RAM (264 KB), it does not have built-in FLASH memory. Instead, that is provided by the external QSPI flash chip. <strong>On this board there is 8 MB</strong>, which is shared between the program it’s running and any file storage used by MicroPython or CircuitPython. When using C/C++ you get the whole flash memory, if using Python you will have about 7 MB remaining for code, files, images, fonts, etc.</p>

<p><strong>RP2040 Chip features:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Dual ARM Cortex-M0+ @ 133 MHz</li>
  <li>264 kB on-chip SRAM in six independent banks</li>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>A new chip means a new ItsyBitsy, and the Raspberry Pi RP2040 is no exception. When we saw this chip we thought “this chip is going to be awesome when we give it the ItsyBitsy teensy-weensy Treatment” and so we did! This Itsy’ features the RP2040, and all niceties you know and love about the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/category/1008">ItsyBitsy family</a>.</p>

<p>What’s smaller than a Feather but larger than a Trinket? It’s an Adafruit ItsyBitsy RP2040 featuring the Raspberry Pi RP2040! Small, powerful, with a ultra fast duel Cortex M0+ processor running at 125 MHz - this microcontroller board is perfect when you want something very compact, with lots of horsepower and a bunch of pins. This Itsy has sports car speed, but SUV roominess with 4 MB of FLASH and 264 KB of SRAM.</p>

<p>ItsyBitsy RP2040 is only 1.4” long by 0.7” wide, but has 6 power pins, 23 digital GPIO pins (4 of which can be analog in and 16 x PWM out). It’s the same chip as the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/4884">Feather RP2040</a> and <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/4883">Raspberry Pi Pico</a> <em>but really really small</em>. So it’s great once you’ve finished up a prototype, and want to make the project much smaller. It even comes with 4MB of SPI Flash built in, for data logging, file storage, or CircuitPython/MicroPython code</p>

<h2 id="technical-details">Technical details</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Same size and form-factor as the rest of the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/category/1008">ItsyBitsy family</a> and nearly-identical pinout</li>

      <li>2 I2C, 2 SPI and 2 UART peripherals, we label one for the ‘main’ interface in standard ItsyBitsy locations</li>
      <li>16 PWM outputs - for servos, LEDs, etc</li>
      <li>The 10 digital ‘non-ADC/non-peripheral’ GPIO are consecutive for maximum PIO compatibility</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Pin #13 red LED</strong> for general purpose blinking</li>
  <li><strong>RGB NeoPixel</strong> with power pin on GPIO so you can depower it for low power usages.</li>

  <li>3.3 V regulator with 500mA peak current output</li>
  <li>3.3 V Power/enable pin</li>
  <li>Power with either USB or external output (such as a battery) - it’ll automatically switch over</li>
  <li>Broken-out SWD pins for debug access</li>
  <li>24 MHz crystal for perfect timing.</li>
  <li>Special <strong>Vhigh</strong> output pin gives you the higher voltage from VBAT or VUSB, for driving NeoPixels, servos, and other 5V-logic devices. <strong>Digital 5</strong> level-shifted output for high-voltage logic level output.</li>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>Strap yourself in, we’re launching in T-minus 10 seconds…Destination? A new Class M planet called MACROPAD! M here, stands for Microcontroller because this 3x4 keyboard controller features the newest technology from the Raspberry Pi sector: say hello to the RP2040. It’s speedy little microcontroller with lots of GPIO pins and a 64 times more RAM than the Apollo Guidance Computer. We added 8 MB of flash memory for plenty of storage.</p>

<p>Get ready to upgrade your desk’s mission control station with a CircuitPython or Arduino powered Macropad - complete with 12 buttons, OLED display, speaker and rotary encoder. Customize it for your spacecraft to help guide you through the great reaches of the unknown. (Or just have it type out your favorite emojis.)</p>

<p>Each of the 12 sockets can accept a Cherry MX-compatible key switch. No soldering required, just snap it in! Use any key switch you like - but we recommend ones with slots that will allow the matching twelve NeoPixels underneath to shine through.</p>

<p>This space-ship is also fitted with a 128x64 monochome OLED for a crisp heads-up display that can be used in Arduino or CircuitPython to display keymaps, stats, computer performance, etc. There’s also a rotary encoder with push-button soldered in. Twist and turn it or push to change volume or monitor brightness or scroll: whatever you like! A tiny speaker can give audio feedback or play fun bleepy tunes.</p>

<p>Want to add more hardware? No worries - <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/category/1018">a STEMMA QT port on the side lets you connect any I2C add-on peripherals from the massive STEMMA QT / Qwiic family of plug in boards</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Please note, the RP2040 chip does not currently have QMK support</strong> - this macropad is designed to be programmed in Arduino or CircuitPython! If QMK eventually does add RP2040 as a supported chipset (no ETA and no plans that we know of), we’ll update this page.</p>

<h2 id="technical-details">Technical details</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Raspberry Pi RP2040 Chip + 8MB Flash memory</strong> - Dual core Cortex M0+ at ~130MHz with 264KB or RAM. Runs CircuitPython, Arduino or MicroPython with ease and lots of space for development code and files</li>
  <li><strong>USB C Connector for Power/Data</strong> - of course this can act as an HID device but also can be MIDI, UART, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>3x4 Mechanical key switch sockets</strong> - accepts any Cherry MX-compatible switches. Individually tied to GPIO pins (not matrix wired)</li>
  <li><strong>One NeoPixel RGB LED per switch</strong>, on north side</li>
  <li><strong>Rotary encoder</strong>, 20 detents per rotation, with push-switch on GPIO pin. Push switch is also used for entering bootloader mode when held down on power-up or reset.</li>
  <li><strong>128x64 SH1106 Monochrome OLED display</strong> - On high speed hardware SPI port for quick updates</li>
  <li><strong>8mm Speaker/Buzzer</strong> - With Class D amplifier and RC filter, can be used to make simple beeps and sounds effects.</li>
  <li><strong>STEMMA QT Connector</strong> - Allows adding any I2C sensors/displays/devices with plug-and-play cables.</li>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>It’s half USB Key, half Adafruit QT Py, and a lotta RP2040<em>…</em>it’s <strong>Trinkey QT2040</strong>, the circuit board with an RP2040 heart and Stemma QT legs. Folks are loving the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4900">QT Py 2040</a> we made, but maybe you want something plug-and-play. So we thought, hey what if we made something like that plugs right into your computer’s USB port? And this is what we came up with!</p>

<p>The PCB is designed to slip into any USB A port on a computer or laptop. There’s an RP2040 microcontroller on board with just enough circuitry to keep it happy. There’s an RGB NeoPixel, a reset and bootloader or user button and a STEMMA QT Port on the end. That’s it!</p>

<p>With the body of the board being 1.0” x 0.7” and four mounting holes, you can attach just about any of our QT boards right on (some are a little larger so just check that has the holes in the same locations). <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3658">Use M2.5 sized standoffs and screws</a> to do so, you could use 2 diagonal at a minimum. Then use a <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4399">shorty QT cable</a> and you’ve got a custom sensor Trinkey for any sensor purpose.</p>

<p>The board comes with 8 MB of QSPI flash memory so you can put <em>all</em> of our CircuitPython drivers on the disk!</p>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>What a cutie pie! Or is it… a QT Py? This diminutive dev board comes with one of our new favorite chip, the RP2040. It’s been made famous in the new <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/pico">Raspberry Pi Pico</a> <em>and</em> our <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/product/4884">Feather RP2040</a> and <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/product/4888">ItsyBitsy RP2040</a>, but what if we wanted something really <em>smol?</em></p>

<p>A new chip means a new QT Py, and the Raspberry Pi RP2040 is no exception. When we saw this chip we thought “this chip is going to be awesome when we give it the cuuutie QT Py Treatment”, and so we did! This QT Py features the RP2040, <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/category/4600">and all niceties you know and love about the original QT Py</a></p>

<p>The star of the QT Py is <a href="http://adafruit.com/stemma">our favorite connector - the STEMMA QT</a>, a chainable I2C port that can be used with <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/category/620">any of our STEMMA QT sensors and accessories</a>. Having this connector means you don’t need to do any soldering to get started.</p>

<p>What can you pop into the QT port? How about <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/?q=qt+oled&amp;main_page=category&amp;cPath=1005&amp;sort=BestMatch">OLEDs</a>! <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/?q=qt+imu&amp;main_page=category&amp;cPath=1005&amp;sort=BestMatch">Inertial Measurment Units</a>! <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/?q=qt+sensor&amp;main_page=category&amp;cPath=1005&amp;sort=BestMatch">Sensors a-plenty</a>.

Just plug in a compatible cable and attach it to your MCU of choice, and you’re ready to load up some software and measure some light.</p>

<p>Use any <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic">SparkFun Qwiic</a> boards! <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4528">Seeed Grove I2C boards</a> will also work with this adapter cable.</p>

<p><strong>At the time of launch, there is no Arduino core support for the chip on this board. There is great <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk">C/C++ support</a>, an official <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/micropython">MicroPython port</a>, and a <a href="https://circuitpython.org/downloads">CircuitPython port</a>!</strong> We of course <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython">recommend CircuitPython because we think it’s the easiest way to get started</a> and it has support with most of our drivers, displays, sensors, and more, supported out of the box so you can follow along with our CircuitPython projects and tutorials.</p>

<p>Pinout and shape is <a href="https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO/">Seeed Xiao</a> compatible, with castellated pads so you can solder it to a PCB with a cut out to allow the bottom components some breathing room. In addition to the QT connector, we also added an <strong>RGB NeoPixel</strong> (with a controllable power pin to allow for ultra-low-power usage), <strong>and both boot-mode and reset buttons</strong> (great for restarting your program or entering the bootloader). This QT Py comes with loose 0.1” headers you can solder in for breadboard use.</p>

<p>While the RP2040 has lots of onboard RAM (264 KB), it does not have built-in FLASH memory. Instead, that is provided by the external QSPI flash chip. On this board there is 4MB, which is shared between the program it’s running and any file storage used by MicroPython or CircuitPython. When using C/C++ you get the whole flash memory, if using Python you will have about 3 MB remaining for code, files, images, fonts, etc.</p>

  <li>264 KB RAM</li>
  <li><strong>8 MB SPI FLASH</strong> chip for storing files and CircuitPython/MicroPython code storage. No EEPROM</li>
  <li>Native USB supported by every OS - can be used in Arduino or CircuitPython as USB serial console, MIDI, Keyboard/Mouse HID, even a little disk drive for storing Python scripts.</li>
  <li>Can be used with <strong>Arduino IDE</strong> or <strong>CircuitPython</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Built-in RGB NeoPixel LED</strong></li>
  <li>13 GPIO pins (11 breakout pads and two QT pads):
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Four</strong> 12 bit ADCs (one more than Pico)</li>
      <li>Two I2C ports (one on the QT connector, one on the breakout pads)</li>
      <li>SPI and UART peripherals, in standard QT Py locations,</li>
      <li>PWM outputs on every IO pin - for servos, LEDs, etc</li>
      <li>There are 6 GPIO in consecutive order for PIO compatibility</li>

  </li>

  <li><strong>Both Reset button and Bootloader select buttons</strong> for quick restarts (no unplugging-replugging to relaunch code)</li>
  <li><strong>Really really small</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Inside the RP2040 is a ‘permanent ROM’ USB UF2 bootloader</strong>. What that means is when you want to program new firmware, you can hold down the BOOT button while plugging it into USB (or pulling down the RUN/Reset pin to ground) and it will appear as a USB disk drive you can drag the firmware onto. Folks who have been using Adafruit products will find this very familiar - we use the technique on all our native-USB boards. Just note you don’t double-click reset, instead hold down BOOTSEL during boot to enter the bootloader!</p>

<p>The RP2040 is a powerful chip, which has the clock speed of our M4 (SAMD51), and two cores that are equivalent to our M0 (SAMD21). Since it is an M0 chip, it does not have a floating point unit or DSP hardware support - so if you’re doing something with heavy floating point math, it will be done in software and thus not as fast as an M4. For many other computational tasks, you’ll get close-to-M4 speeds!</p>

<p>For peripherals, there are two I2C controllers, two SPI controllers, and two UARTs that are multiplexed across the GPIO - check the pinout for what pins can be set to which. There are 16 PWM channels, each pin has a channel it can be set to (ditto on the pinout).</p>

<p>You’ll note there’s no I2S peripheral, or SDIO, or camera, what’s up with that? Well, instead of having specific hardware support for serial-data-like peripherals like these, the RP2040 comes with the PIO state machine system which is a unique and powerful way to create <em>custom hardware logic and data processing blocks</em> that run on their own without taking up a CPU. For example, NeoPixels - often we bitbang the timing-specific protocol for these LEDs. For the RP2040, we instead use PIO object that reads in the data buffer and clocks out the right bitstream with perfect accuracy. <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/tree/master/pio">Same with I2S audio in or out, LED matrix displays, 8-bit or SPI based TFTs, even VGA</a>! In MicroPython and CircuitPython you can create PIO control commands to script the peripheral and load it in at runtime. There are 2 PIO peripherals with 4 state machines each.</p>

<p>By BeagleBoard</p> <p>If you liked the BeagleBone Black Rev B, you will love the Rev C! The Rev C has a blistering 1GHz AM3358 processor and 512MB onboard DDR3 RAM, two 46-pin headers, micro HDMI for audio/video output, USB ports, 10/100 Ethernet and other I/O features. The Rev C is an ultra-powered embedded computer that can fit in a mint tin.</p>

<p>This model includes 4GB of eMMC built-in storage instead of the Rev B’s 2GB. With the doubled storage and faster eMMC, the developers were able to make the Rev C’s most significant change: shipping the BeagleBone Black with Debian Linux pre-loaded on the board’s flash instead of Angstrom Linux. Debian Linux is a more user-friendly operating system than Angstrom and the switch to Debian is partly the result of consumer demand (especially from Adafruit users, thanks!)</p>

<p>Of course the BeagleBone Black Rev C is an open board so if you want to load it back up with Angstrom or other Linux-based distributions like Ubuntu or Android, you can.</p>

<p>The rev C comes with a mini-B cable for powering it up ASAP. No microSD card is included as the BBB has onboard flash storage - and no SD card loading is required to get started. Please note the PCB may say rev B, that’s normal! The rev C has more memory which did not affect the PCB revision code.</p>

<p>By Diodes Delight</p> <p>Piunora is a compact, easy-to-use development board for electronics prototyping with Linux. It has a familiar form factor, legible pin labels, and a design that’s well suited to space-constrained applications.</p>

<p>As a carrier board for the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/compute-module-4/?variant=raspberry-pi-cm4001000">Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4</a> (CM4), Piunora is essentially a tiny version of the Raspberry Pi 4 Single Board Computer (SBC) with added flexibility to accommodate custom form factors. CM4-based devices like Piunora are fully compatible with software that was written for the Raspberry Pi 4, as long as that software accounts for the hardware peripherals in use. There are also versions of the CM4 that include eMMC memory, which is more reliable than a traditional SD card.</p>

<p>It may be small, but Piunora is packed with powerful peripherals that will come in handy for rapid prototyping and embedded machine-learning applications. Examples include an HDMI port, camera-input connectors, and PCI-e support, which is not present on a standard Raspberry Pi 4. Finally, the M.2 B-Key port on the rear of the board is not only useful for SSD storage, it can also host a diverse range of PCI-e expansion boards.</p>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>Wouldn’t it be cool to drive a tiny OLED display, read a color sensor, or even just flash some LEDs directly from your computer?  Sure you can program an Arduino or Trinket to talk to these devices and your computer, but why can’t your computer just talk to those devices and sensors itself?  Well, now your computer can talk to devices using the Adafruit FT232H breakout board!</p>

<p>What can the FT232H chip do?  This chip from FTDI is similar to their USB to serial converter chips but adds a ‘multi-protocol synchronous serial engine’ which allows it to speak many common protocols like SPI, I2C, serial UART, JTAG, and more!  There’s even a handful of digital GPIO pins that you can read and write to do things like flash LEDs, read switches or buttons, and more.  The FT232H breakout is like adding a little swiss army knife for serial protocols to your computer!</p>

<p>This chip is powerful and useful to have when you want to use Python (for example) to quickly iterate and test a device that uses I2C, SPI or plain general purpose I/O. There’s no firmware to deal with, so you don’t have to deal with how to “send data to and from an Arduino which is then sent to and from” an electronic sensor or display or part.</p>

<p>By Groboards</p> <p>The Giant Board is a super tiny single-board computer (SBC) based on the Adafruit Feather form factor. We always want more power in a smaller package, and the Giant Board delivers! It provides a small, powerful platform that is compatible with a wide range of pre-existing accessories. FeatherWing support makes the Giant Board a flexible, drop-in component for most Feather based projects.</p>

<p>We all love our microcontrollers, but in some cases they just don’t have the resources we need to carry out the projects we have in mind. By squeezing the power of an SBC into a package the size of a microcontroller board, the Giant Board relaxes memory, storage, and processing constraints and allows you to take your projects to the next level.</p>

<p>The Giant Board fills the gap between microcontrollers and other single-board computers. It makes a great alternative to a Raspberry Pi or BeagleBone in a space constrained project where you need more power than a typical microcontroller can provide. The Giant Board is based on a form factor that is traditionally used for microcontrollers, so power consumption is important, which is why the Giant Board offers low-power modes.</p>

<p>To leverage all that powerful hardware, the Giant Board runs Linux. Not just any Linux, but full Debian Linux! This gives developers and users access to an endless number of applications and libraries for their projects.</p>

<p>By Great Scott Gadgets</p> <p><strong>GreatFET One</strong> from <a href="https://greatscottgadgets.com/">Great Scott Gadgets</a> is a hardware hacker’s best friend. At the center is a powerful NXP LPC4330 (Cortex M4 @ 204MHz) with two USB ports, one host and one peripheral, so it can act as a ‘man in the middle’ for USB interfacing. With an extensible, open source design, two USB ports, and 100 expansion pins, GreatFET One is your essential gadget for hacking, making, and reverse engineering. By adding expansion boards called neighbors, you can turn GreatFET One into a USB peripheral that does almost anything.</p>

<p>Whether you need an interface to an external chip, a logic analyzer, a debugger, or just a whole lot of pins to bit-bang, the versatile GreatFET One is the tool for you. Hi-Speed USB and a Python API allow GreatFET One to become your custom USB interface to the physical world.</p>

<ul>
  <li>programmable digital I/O</li>
  <li>serial protocols including SPI, I2C, UART, and JTAG</li>
  <li>logic analysis</li>
  <li>analog I/O (ADC/DAC)</li>
  <li>data acquisition</li>
  <li>debugging</li>
  <li>versatile USB functions including FaceDancer</li>
  <li>high-throughput hardware-assisted streaming serial engine</li>
  <li>four fabulous LEDs!</li>
</ul>

<p>GreatFET One ships in an ESD bag with a high-speed USB cable and a <a href="https://greatscottgadgets.com/wiggler">wiggler</a> for easy separation of neighbors. Enclosures and neighbors are sold separately.</p>

<p>GreatFET is a next generation <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1279">GoodFET</a> intended to serve as your custom Hi-Speed USB peripheral through the addition of expansion boards called “neighbors”.</p>

<p>GreatFET is designed to provide a significant step up in capabilities from <a href="http://github.com/travisgoodspeed/goodfet">GoodFET</a> while making the design manufacturable at a lower cost than GoodFET. In addition to being designed for automated assembly, it can be hand-assembled with a soldering iron, though it is a more complicated assembly than GoodFET. An important similarity to GoodFET is that GreatFET has a USB bootloader in ROM, so it is possible to build a board by hand and install firmware onto it without the need of any external programming hardware.</p>

<p>By Sifive</p> <p>We founded SiFive to bring the power of open source to the semiconductor industry. We do this not only by supporting the RISC-V specification, but also by implementing the specification and getting usable chips into the hands of developers as quickly as we can. We did exactly that just over a year ago when we introduced the open source, Arduino-compatible HiFive1 dev board based on our Freedom Everywhere line of 32-bit microcontrollers. Today, we’re proud to be doing the same thing with our Freedom Unleashed 64-bit, Linux-capable system-on-chip (SoC) platform. Meet the HiFive Unleashed, the world’s first RISC-V-based, Linux-capable development board.</p>

<p>Industry skeptics have previously dismissed RISC-V as an academic project, low performance, and only for microcontrollers. HiFive Unleashed, featuring the SiFive Freedom U540 SoC, ends all of that. Linux and RISC-V were meant for each other, and the HiFive Unleashed dev board brings them together for the first time.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Processor: SiFive Freedom U540 SoC</li>
  <li>Memory: 8 GB DDR4 with ECC</li>
  <li>Connectivity: Gigabit Ethernet port</li>
  <li>Flash: 32 MB quad SPI flash from ISSI</li>
  <li>Storage: microSD card for removable storage</li>
  <li>Expansion: FMC connector for future expansion</li>

<p>By Adafruit</p> <p>Wouldn’t it be cool to drive a <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/categories/98">tiny OLED display</a>, read a <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/1334">color sensor</a>, or even just flash some LEDs directly from your computer?  Sure you can program an <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/50">Arduino</a> or <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/2000">Trinket</a> to talk to these devices and your computer, but why can’t your computer just talk to those devices and sensors itself?  Well, now your computer <em>can</em> talk to devices using the Adafruit MCP2221A breakout board!</p>

<p>What can the MCP2221 chip do?  This chip from <a href="https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/MCP2221A">Microchip</a> is similar to a USB to serial converter chips but adds a GPIO and I2C interface as well. The analog/digital GPIO pins can act as 10-bit analog inputs (ADC) and there’s even a 5-bit DAC output. The I2C interface is great for talking to OLEDs, sensors, PWM drivers, its the most popular interface for small devices. You can use the GPIO to do things like flash LEDs, read switches or buttons, and more. The MCP2221A breakout is like adding a little swiss army knife for serial protocols to your computer!</p>

<p>This chip is powerful and useful to have when you want to use Python (for example) to quickly iterate and test a device that uses I2C or general purpose digital and analog I/O. There’s no firmware to deal with, so you don’t have to deal with how to “send data to and from an Arduino which is then sent to and from” an electronic sensor or display or part.</p>

<p>By Onion Corporation</p> <p>Ever wanted your own Linux-based IoT computer? A small one, that can be battery powered? The Onion Omega2 is sort of in-between a microcontroller (like an Arduino/CircuitPython/MakeCode running chip) and a full-fledged microcomputer (like Raspbery Pi). What you get is a bite-sized development board that combines the power-efficiency of the Arduino and the flexibility of the Raspberry Pi!</p>

<p>So, for example, it runs Linux, but isn’t going to replace your desktop computer. It’s low power and has a static filesystem, but still requires some time to boot up. It’s based on the MediaTek MT7688, a WiFi SoC that was initially designed for devices like WiFi routers or complex IoT devices. It comes with a variant of OpenWRT (nicknamed Onion OS) that is a slimmed down version of Linux. It’s not going to run node.js or minecraft but it is Linux. So, you get WiFi built in, and a full TCP/IP stack with SSL/TLS with all the scripting/programming language support that you expect.</p>

<p>Unlike a Raspberry Pi, you don’t get a desktop or even a console on HDMI. Instead, you use a serial connection/ssh and the command line, or the simplified webpage interface to program it. So it’s good if you have a bit of experience with those things!</p>

<p>Where it excels is as a physical computing platform, with hardware and WiFi. Wanna know how to blink an LED, or even multiple (!) LEDs? You can do that! You’ll be able to read switches and use shift registers. Blinking text? No problem! A 7-Segment display and an LCD screen are included! The Maker Kit even comes with relay, PWM/servo and OLED add-ons so you can have a display and robotics interfacing. Comes with all the fixins’ to get comfortable with IoT and programming languages, including Python, C++, Node js, php, Bash, Ruby, Perl, Lua, G, and more!</p>

<p>This maker kit has everything you need to fully build and prototype just about any kind of project you can think of with Onion Omega2+. Once you have your project or product well-developed you can then purchase individual Omega2’s and add-on boards from Onion.</p>

<p>By BeagleBoard</p> <p>Want a powerful 1GHz AM3358 powered Linux single board that’s ultra-tiny and open-source? PocketBeagle offers a wealth of computer power in a small footprint (pawprint?). This board is just like the BeagleBone Black but small enough to fit in your wallet. It has a fully-integrated chip that combines the processor and RAM all on one chip, so it’s super small. Despite the compact shape, there are 72 total breakout pads, a microSD card slot for your filesystem and OS, and a native USB connection</p>

<p>Compared to other single board Linux computers, what differentiates the BeagleBone is that it has multiple I2C, SPI and UART peripherals (many boards only have one of each), built in hardware PWMs, analog inputs, and two separate 200MHz microcontroller system called the PRU that can handle real-time tasks like displaying to RGB matrix displays or NeoPixels.</p>

<p>It’s not too much larger than our Feathers, but comes with 72 expansion pin headers, high-speed USB, 8 analog pins, 44 digital I/Os, and plenty of digital interface peripherals.</p>

<p>You can also add a USB host connection by wiring a USB A socket to the broken out USB host connections labeled VI, D+, D-, ID and GND. Then plug in any USB Ethernet, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi device with available Linux drivers.</p>

<p>By Damien George</p> <p>The pyboard is a compact and powerful electronics development board that runs MicroPython. It connects to your PC over USB, giving you a USB flash drive to save your Python scripts, and a serial Python prompt (a REPL) for instant programming. Requires a micro USB cable, and will work with Windows, Mac and Linux.</p>

<p>There are 3 main ways to control the pyboard:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>REPL:</strong> Connecting to your PC via USB, the board appears as a USB virtual comms port (CDC VCP) and you can use any serial program to connect and get a Python REPL prompt. This allows you to instantly type and execute Python commands, just like you would when running Python on your PC. You can also redirect the REPL to any of the UARTs on the pyboard.</li>
  <li><strong>Remote script:</strong> You can change from REPL to raw REPL mode by sending ctrl-A, and then in raw REPL mode you can send an arbitrary Python script to the board for it to execute immediately. A Python script is available which makes using this mode very simple: you just run python pyboard.py script_to_run.py and this will execute script_to_run.py on the pyboard, returning any output.</li>
  <li><strong>From file:</strong> The pyboard has a small, built-in filesystem which lives in part of the flash memory of the microcontroller. It also has an SD card slot if you want to extend the available storage. When you connect the pyboard to your PC, it appears as a USB flash storage device and you can access (mount) the internal filesystem and the SD card this way. If you copy a Python script to the filesystem and call it main.py then the board will execute this script when it starts up. This way you can run scripts without being connected to a PC.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Main features of the hardware:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>STM32F405RG microcontroller</li>
  <li>168 MHz Cortex M4 CPU with hardware floating point</li>
  <li>1024KiB flash ROM and 192KiB RAM</li>
  <li>Micro USB connector for power and serial communication</li>
  <li>Micro SD card slot, supporting standard and high capacity SD cards</li>
  <li>3-axis accelerometer (MMA7660)</li>
  <li>Real time clock with optional battery backup</li>
  <li>24 GPIO on left and right edges and 5 GPIO on bottom row, plus LED and switch GPIO available on bottom row</li>
  <li>3x 12-bit analog to digital converters, available on 16 pins, 4 with analog ground shielding</li>
  <li>2x 12-bit digital to analog (DAC) converters, available on pins X5 and X6</li>
  <li>4 LEDs (red, green, yellow and blue)</li>
  <li>1 reset and 1 user switch</li>
  <li>On-board 3.3V LDO voltage regulator, capable of supplying up to 300mA, input voltage range 3.6V to 10V</li>
  <li>DFU bootloader in ROM for easy upgrading of firmware</li>

<p>By Raspberry Pi</p> <p>The Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+ is the latest board for the minimalist Pi fan. Like the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, it boasts a 64-bit quad core processor running at 1.4 GHz, dual-band 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz wireless LAN, and Bluetooth 4.3/BLE. This low-cost Pi uses the same processor as the model 3 B+, but does away with the Ethernet jack and three of the USB ports. It’s still compatible with all Pi operating systems and software, and has the exact same 40 pin GPIO connector and camera/display sockets, so any HATs or Pi Plates or other things that plug into the model B+ will work just the same.</p>

<p>By Raspberry Pi</p> <p>The Raspberry Pi foundation changed single-board computing when they released the Raspberry Pi computer, now they’re ready to do the same for microcontrollers with the release of the brand new <strong>Raspberry Pi Pico</strong>. This low-cost microcontroller board features a powerful new chip, the <strong>RP2040</strong>, and all the fixin’s to get started with embedded electronics projects at a stress-free price.</p>

<p>The Pico is 0.825” x 2” and can have headers soldered in for use in a breadboard or perfboard, or can be soldered directly onto a PCB with the castellated pads. There’s 20 pads on each side, with groups of general purpose input-and-output (GPIO) pins interleaved with plenty of ground pins. All of the GPIO pins are 3.3V logic, and are not 5V-safe so stick to 3V! You get a total of 25 GPIO pins (technically there are 26 but IO #15 has a special purpose and should not be used by projects), 3 of those can be analog inputs (the chip has 4 ADC but one is not broken out). There are no true analog output (DAC) pins.</p>

<p>On the slim green board is minimal circuitry to get you going: A 5V to 3.3V power supply converter, single green LED on GP25, boot select button, RP2040 chip with dual-core Cortex M0, 2 MegaBytes of QSPI flash storage, and crystal.</p>

<p><strong>Inside the RP2040 is a ‘permanent ROM’ USB UF2 bootloader.</strong> What that means is when you want to program new firmware, you can hold down the BOOTSEL button while plugging it into USB (or pulling down the RUN/Reset pin to ground) and it will appear as a USB disk drive you can drag the firmware onto. Folks who have been using Adafruit products will find this very familiar - we use the technique all our native-USB boards. Just note you don’t double-click reset, instead hold down BOOTSEL during boot to enter the bootloader!</p>

<p>The RP2040 is a powerful chip, which has the clock speed of our M4 (SAMD51), and two cores that are equivalent to our M0 (SAMD21). Since it is an M0 chip, it does not have a floating point unit, or DSP hardware support - so if you’re doing something with heavy floating point math, it will be done in software and thus not as fast as an M4. For many other computational tasks, you’ll get close-to-M4 speeds!</p>

<p>For peripherals, there are two I2C controllers, two SPI controllers, and two UARTs that are multiplexed across the GPIO - check the pinout for what pins can be set to which. There are 16 PWM channels, each pin has a channel it can be set to (ditto on the pinout).</p>

<p>You’ll note there’s no I2S peripheral, or SDIO, or camera, what’s up with that? Well instead of having specific hardware support for serial-data-like peripherals like these, the RP2040 comes with the PIO state machine system which is a unique and powerful way to create custom hardware logic and data processing blocks that run on their own without taking up a CPU. For example, NeoPixels - often we bitbang the timing-specific protocol for these LEDs. For the RP2040, we instead use a PIO object that reads in the data buffer and clocks out the right bitstream with perfect accuracy. Same with I2S audio in or out, LED matrix displays, 8-bit or SPI based TFTs, even VGA! In MicroPython and CircuitPython you can create PIO control commands to script the peripheral and load it in at runtime. There are 2 PIO peripherals with 4 state machines each.</p>

<p><strong>At the time of launch, there is no Arduino core support for this board. There is <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk">great C/C++ support</a>, an official <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/micropython">MicroPython port</a>, and a CircuitPython port!</strong> We of course <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython">recommend CircuitPython because we think its the easiest way to get started</a> and it has support with most our drivers, displays, sensors, and more, supported out of the box so you can follow along with our CircuitPython projects and tutorials.</p>

<p>While the RP2040 has lots of onboard RAM (264KB), it does not have built in FLASH memory. Instead that is provided by the external QSPI flash chip. On this board there is 2MB, which is shared between the program its running and any file storage used by MicroPython or CircuitPython. When using C/C++ you get the whole flash memory, if using Python you will have about 1 MB remaining for code, files, images, fonts, etc.</p>

<p>By Raspberry Pi</p> <p>At first glance, the Pi Zero isn’t much.  It just looks like a slimmed down version of the Raspberry Pi we know and love.  But when we started to think of the possibilities - and what a well-chosen set of accessories could add - we realized the appeal.  And then we saw the price…could it be true? Yes!</p>

<p>This is the slimmest, most pared down Raspberry Pi to date.  It’s kind of like the little cousin to the Pi 2 - with just a micro SD card slot, a mini HDMI port, two micro USB ports (one for power, one for USB), and 512MB of RAM. It has a single-core 1 GHz processor chip, similar to the Pi A+ and B+.</p>

<p>By Raspberry Pi</p> <p><strong>Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W</strong> is the latest product in Raspberry Pi’s most affordable range of single-board computers. The successor to the breakthrough Raspberry Pi Zero W, <strong>Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W</strong> is a form factor–compatible drop-in replacement for the original board.</p>

<p>The board incorporates a quad-core 64-bit Arm Cortex-A53 CPU, clocked at 1GHz. At its heart is a Raspberry Pi RP3A0 system-in-package (SiP), integrating a Broadcom BCM2710A1 die with 512MB of LPDDR2 SDRAM. The upgraded processor provides Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W with 40% more single-threaded performance, and five times more multi-threaded performance, than the original single-core Raspberry Pi Zero. Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W offers 2.4GHz 802.11 b/g/n wireless LAN and Bluetooth 4.2, along with support for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and modular compliance certification.</p>

<p>The board has a microSD card slot, a CSI-2 camera connector, a USB On-The-Go (OTG) port, and an unpopulated footprint for a HAT-compatible 40-pin GPIO header. It is powered via a micro USB socket. Video output is via a mini HDMI port; composite video output can easily be made available via test points, if needed. Sharing the same form factor as the original Raspberry Pi Zero, Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W fits inside most existing Raspberry Pi Zero cases.</p>
